 *
 * `global-setup-natives` builds `@bastani/atomic-natives` only when no

 * gracefully: `packages/subagents` imports the Rust control plane statically,

 * `grep` calls from the syntax-minified sidecar. On the happy path this is a
 * single `existsSync`, so CI — which builds the binding in an explicit step
