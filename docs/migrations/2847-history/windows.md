# Historical windows documentation

These blocks preserve the documentation at baseline `59586efd26afd32a27c999ac8bcce102777e40e4` for issue #2847. They are historical evidence, not current instructions. Current documentation incorporates main `cb13229bebe30ea7cb65689569569494b4bc651c`. The original baseline inventory and destination map remain unchanged.

## Install

Install the self-contained Windows release archive with Windows PowerShell 5.1 or newer:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bastani-inc/atomic/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

This path does not require Node.js or a package manager. To pin an exact release:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bastani-inc/atomic/main/install.ps1))) -Ref 0.9.11
```

The installer verifies `SHA256SUMS` before changing an existing install. It stores versioned payloads under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\atomic` and places an ASCII-only `atomic.cmd` plus an `atomic-current` junction in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\atomic\bin` by default. The relative shim remains safe when the install path contains Unicode text or the bin directory is elsewhere. Set `ATOMIC_INSTALL_DIR`, `ATOMIC_BIN_DIR`, or `ATOMIC_VERSION` to override those values. `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` is optional for higher GitHub API limits. Exact pins use Atomic's `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` or `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha.REVISION` release tag form.

Every attempt removes its own `atomic-install-*` staging directory under the Windows temp path before it finishes. Windows can hold a file or an executable image open briefly after the process that used it exits, so the installer clears read-only attributes, retries the removal a bounded number of times, and verifies the directory is gone after each try. If it still cannot remove the directory, it reports the exact path, the number of attempts, and the last Windows error instead of leaving the residue unmentioned. A cleanup failure never replaces the original error: when an install fails for another reason, that error is still the one you see and the incomplete cleanup is reported as a warning.

After the script is fetched, it enables TLS 1.2 for its own GitHub requests and restores the caller's prior protocol setting. A downloaded script cannot repair the connection used to fetch itself: on a legacy Windows PowerShell 5.1 host where the literal `irm` command cannot reach GitHub, enable TLS 1.2 in that shell before rerunning the same one-liner.

The installer adds the bin directory to the User PATH and the current PowerShell process. Restart the terminal when it finishes so other processes see the new PATH. A custom `ATOMIC_BIN_DIR` containing `;` cannot be one Windows PATH entry, so the installer leaves PATH untouched and prints a direct-run command for `atomic.cmd` instead. If the bin directory already holds a same-stem launcher that `PATHEXT` resolves before `atomic.cmd`, such as a stale `atomic.exe` from an older Node-based install, the installer reports it and stops before downloading anything; remove that entry and rerun. Because the shim is `atomic.cmd`, `PATHEXT` must include `.CMD` for bare `atomic` to resolve; if it does not, the installer says so and stops rather than reporting a success you could not use. An unexpected regular `current` entry under `ATOMIC_INSTALL_DIR`, or a regular `atomic-current` entry under `ATOMIC_BIN_DIR`, is reported and left untouched instead of being moved or deleted. A pinned `-Ref` is honored literally: if GitHub answers with a different release tag, the install stops before downloading anything. Package-manager installation remains available but requires Node.js; see the [Quickstart](/quickstart#package-managers).

By default, Atomic uses a Bash shell for the `bash` tool and `!`/`!!` shortcuts. If you use those surfaces, Atomic checks these locations in order:

1. Custom path from `~/.atomic/agent/settings.json` (legacy `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` also supported)
2. Git Bash (`C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`)
3. `bash.exe` on PATH (Cygwin, MSYS2, WSL)

For users who want the default Bash surfaces, [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) is sufficient. Native Windows users can instead enable the optional PowerShell tool described below; `!`/`!!` remain Bash-only.

## Interactive Startup

Atomic mounts the themed startup identity and focused editor before waiting for the isolated engine to finish binding. You can type immediately; submitting a prompt shows the working indicator while startup finishes. Escape cancels a submission that is still blocked on optional-resource readiness, so it cannot dispatch later. If resource loading fails before admission, Atomic restores the exact draft, sends no provider request, and reports the generation failure once. An older engine generation cannot release or reject its replacement's submission.

The isolated engine binds a mandatory minimal runtime first, with Intercom available, then stages bundled workflows, subagents, MCP, web access, optional tools, provider overrides, skills, prompts, and themes. Prompt dispatch, extension commands, model/resource commands, session replacement, and tool-aware RPC operations wait for a generation-scoped resource-ready gate. After a failure, `/reload` starts a fresh transactional resource attempt instead of waiting forever on the rejected gate. `session_start` messages wait too. A failed transactional candidate does not publish host-managed settings, providers, tools, resources, event subscriptions, or system-prompt state. Extension-owned session-scoped objects remain shared by design and are not rolled back.

The same source path is used for package-manager and release-archive builds. Node installs retain Node's persistent compile cache and its `NODE_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=1` coverage opt-out. Release builds syntax-minify the shared application sidecar without shortening identifiers and compile the launcher with bytecode on Windows x64 and ARM64, matching Linux and macOS — but Bun 1.4.0 Windows bytecode launchers must be compiled on a Windows host. Despite the embedded-bytecode alignment fix ([#26299](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/26299)) and integrity fallback ([#31961](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/31961)), the same compile cross-run from a non-Windows host produces an executable that segfaults before user code runs, even on `--version`: the 0.9.18-alpha.1 payload was built on Linux, so the shipped Windows launcher crashed while the Windows-hosted smoke build passed. `publish.yml` therefore builds both Windows archives on the Windows runner and the Linux release-payload job runs `build-binaries.sh --skip-windows`. The pinned Bun 1.4.0 probe cross-compiles `bun-windows-x64-baseline` and `bun-windows-arm64` launchers and verifies their PE machine types. Cross-compilation does not prove runtime compatibility, so release validation must still exercise the full archive, TUI, workflows, tools, extensions, workers, and native add-ons on Windows x64 and real Windows ARM64 hardware. No measured Windows speedup is claimed yet.

### PowerShell tool

On native Windows, Atomic registers the `powershell` tool by default when PowerShell 7 (`pwsh.exe`) or Windows PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) is on `PATH`. If neither executable is available, the tool is omitted so the agent is not offered a command that cannot run. Add `powershell` to `defaultTools` to enable it explicitly when you want it active alongside a narrower built-in selection. The `bash` tool and `!`/`!!` shortcuts continue to use Bash. Both `ATOMIC_*` and legacy `PI_*` session variables are available.

PowerShell calls are rendered in the transcript with a `PS>` prompt so they are never mistaken for Bash, and truncated PowerShell output is spilled to its own `atomic-powershell-*` temp file rather than the Bash one.

The package root exports `createPowerShellTool()`, `createPowerShellToolDefinition()`, `createLocalPowerShellOperations()`, their public option/input/detail types, and `getPowerShellConfig()` for SDK integrations. Factory-created tools expose the current `ATOMIC_*` and legacy `PI_*` session snapshot by default; set `exposeSessionEnvironment: false` to opt out. Executing the default local operations remains Windows-only and requires a resolvable PowerShell executable.
