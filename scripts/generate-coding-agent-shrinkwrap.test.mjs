/**
 * pi parity: repository scripts that Node can run are tested with Node's own
 * runner, not through the workspace suites.
 *
 * `node --test scripts/*.test.mjs` is the whole story -- no vitest, no config,
 * no transform. That matters most for this script in particular: it is the one
 * that turns the root `package-lock.json` into the shrinkwrap published inside
 * `@bastani/atomic`, so it now sits directly on the lockfile that `npm ci`
 * verifies rather than beside a second, unverified one.
