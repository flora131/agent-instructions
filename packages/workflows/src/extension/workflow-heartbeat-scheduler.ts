	 * rejected storage write as persisted and never retry it.
	 *

	 * natural schedule pass. It deliberately does not call `refresh()`, which
	 * would turn a persistently failing backend into a retry loop.
	 *
	 * The in-flight marker is also what makes a late acknowledgement safe after
	 * terminal cleanup (issue #1975): cleanup removes the marker, so a write that
	 * resolves afterwards finds nothing to remove and records nothing, rather
	 * than re-creating an `anchorPersisted` entry for a run that is finished.
	 *
	 * Only reached for a positive cadence, because `scheduleWorkflowHeartbeats`
	 * returns `disabled` above this point — so a run launched with heartbeats off
	 * leaves no durable artifact of any kind, which is what the acceptance
	 * criterion "disabled (0) creates no timer or record" requires.
