# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The retained embedded Postgres process now starts on Windows administrative accounts with the same restricted access token `pg_ctl` applies: the Administrators and Power Users SIDs become deny-only, every privilege except the ones PostgreSQL keeps is deleted, and the current user is re-added to the token's default DACL so the postmaster's own child processes remain creatable. The exact process handle from `CreateProcessAsUserW` stays the retained lease, preserving exact-handle fast shutdown, retry-after-timeout ownership, and release-without-kill semantics. Non-administrative Windows accounts keep the previous spawn path unchanged, and Unix privilege handling is untouched.
- Preserved log-file stdout/stderr and closed stdin on regular Windows launches, released the child thread handle after each retained spawn, and honored Unicode case-insensitive environment overrides. Restricted launches now clean up partially acquired standard handles and propagate failed process observations instead of reporting the process as still running.
- Preserved executable lookup through `PATH` and relative paths for administrative Windows Postgres launches, including child environment overrides. Embedded NUL characters in launch paths, arguments, or environment entries are rejected before a process starts instead of truncating inputs or injecting environment variables.

## [0.9.19-alpha.2] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Added replay-safe model and reasoning activity reports and retained model and thinking fields on task snapshots, including settled tasks.
- Added an environment-local `TaskSupervisor` actor with owner-sealed admission, stable task/attempt identities, replay-safe reports, observation waits, cancellation and independently acknowledged cleanup. Generated bindings expose atomic snapshot subscriptions with a byte-bounded event journal; total task/report history and output storage are not bounded by this journal ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Added supervised Unix pipe/PTY commands with process-group cleanup, observation-independent execution deadlines, replay-safe byte-credit stdin, resize and retained output paging. Drained output stays live beyond its cap; background file-spool overflow settles `OutputLimitExceeded` ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Added Windows pipe task containment with suspended launch, explicit inherited handles and kill-on-close Job Objects. Assignment failure refuses execution and confirms suspended-process cleanup; failed cleanup retains diagnostic resources. Supervised Windows PTY remains unavailable ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Added a read-only `taskSettlement` query for authentic terminal receipts, including cancellation, so hosts can recover completion delivery after journal resets without registering another wait. Task snapshots retain `wasBackground` after a designated wait yields, including after settlement.
- Added supervised Windows ConPTY commands with suspended launch, Job Object containment before resume, retained output and confirmed cleanup. Containment failure refuses execution without an unsupervised fallback.
- Added optional `CommandIntent.shell: { program, args }` for direct executable launch with the command as one final argv argument, and `inheritEnv` (default `true`; `false` uses exactly the supplied environment). Both participate in operation replay identity; the default native pipe shell is unchanged.

### Changed

- Raised the minimum supported Bun runtime to 1.4.2.

### Fixed

- Enforced the task file cap through shared supervised pipe draining on Unix and Windows, preventing stdout/stderr and descendant writes from bypassing the budget. Output page requests are clamped to 1 MiB before allocation ([#2905](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2905)).
- Preserved numeric task wait budgets above the u32 range and fractional milliseconds; timer scheduling no longer wraps `4294967296` ms into an immediate yield ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Preserved completed/failed task exit-code numbers without i32 narrowing, including unsigned statuses, fractional values and negative zero; exact terminal replay no longer collapses distinct numeric inputs ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Preserved exact activity metric replay for `elapsedMs`, `toolCount` and `tokenCount`: identical NaN reports acknowledge once, while changed signed zero or omitted/present fields conflict without normalizing values ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Preserved S1 caller strings losslessly across owner scopes, launch/report identity, activity, results and nested output/cleanup metadata; unpaired UTF-16 surrogates no longer become replacement characters or collapse distinct replays ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Bounded S1 activity replay identity to the latest 256 accepted IDs with SHA-256 payload hashes instead of retaining full report history. Evicted IDs are fresh reports subject to lifecycle guards; terminal reports and receipts remain retained for the task record's lifetime ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Allocated trusted S1 runner terminal identities atomically against the bounded activity window, so caller report IDs cannot consume the runner's settlement identity. Caller outcome conflicts, immutable terminal replay and cancellation precedence remain unchanged ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Prevented accepted `NaN` task wait budgets from panicking the native timer. Such waits use bounded sleep chunks until another observation or lifecycle action finishes them; finite budgets and infinities retain their existing behavior ([#2884](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2884)).
- Retry transient macOS permission errors while checking whether a terminated process group has disappeared, within the existing cleanup deadline. Unreaped zombies no longer cause immediate cleanup failure; persistent refusals still fail closed.

## [0.9.16] - 2026-08-29

Cumulative release of the `0.9.16-alpha.1` prerelease. The summary below covers the user-visible outcome of that work; the per-change detail remains in the prerelease section below.

### Added

- Added the opaque retained-Postgres lease used by workflow durability: direct log-redirected spawn, Unix uid/gid ownership with inherited supplementary groups cleared before a root privilege drop, process-instance-safe PostgreSQL fast shutdown on Unix and Windows, bounded wait/reap, retry retention after timeout, and explicit release without termination ([#2544](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2544) by [@darionco](https://github.com/darionco)).

## [0.9.16-alpha.1] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Added the opaque retained-Postgres lease used by workflow durability: direct log-redirected spawn, Unix uid/gid ownership with inherited supplementary groups cleared before a root privilege drop, process-instance-safe PostgreSQL fast shutdown on Unix and Windows, bounded wait/reap, retry retention after timeout, and explicit release without termination ([#2544](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/pull/2544) by [@darionco](https://github.com/darionco)).

## [0.9.13] - 2026-08-13

Cumulative release of the `0.9.13-alpha.1` prerelease. The summary below covers the user-visible outcome of that work; the per-change detail remains in the prerelease section below.

### Added

- Added the Rust `SubagentControl` N-API surface that backs Atomic's in-process subagents: canonical child identities, RAII spawn reservations, turn-scoped execution guards, LRU residency, status watches, and an explicit 100 ms interruption grace ([#2188](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/2188)).

### Changed

- Child termination is awaitable across the N-API boundary, so the 100 ms cooperative grace no longer blocks the JavaScript thread, and termination causes are reported on child identities and status-watch updates ([#2188](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/2188)).
- Generated N-API string enums are literal TypeScript unions, so strict isolated-module consumers can use subagent statuses and causes without ambient const-enum errors ([#2188](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/2188)).

## [0.9.13-alpha.1] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Added the Rust `SubagentControl` N-API surface with canonical child identities, RAII spawn reservations, turn-scoped execution guards, LRU residency, status watches, and explicit 100 ms interruption grace for in-process subagents ([#2188](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/2188)).

### Changed

- Generated N-API string-enum declarations as literal TypeScript unions so strict isolated-module consumers can use subagent statuses and causes without ambient const-enum errors ([#2188](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/2188)).
- Made child termination awaitable across the N-API boundary so the literal 100 ms cooperative grace does not block the JavaScript thread, and exposed termination causes on child identities and status-watch updates ([#2188](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/issues/2188)).
