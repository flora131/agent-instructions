/**
 * Classification for a *recoverable* Intercom broker disconnect.
 *
 * The client socket is gone, but the lightweight extension wrapper owns
 * recovery: a failed lazy-initialization attempt is discarded, and the next
 * call re-imports the heavy module and reconnects. Work the user did not ask
 * for — session lifecycle events and background event relays — must therefore
 * not render such a disconnect as a failure while that retry is still ahead.
 * Explicit, user-initiated operations keep rejecting visibly.
 *
 * Classification is by construction, never by message text. Only errors this
 * module creates carry the marker, so an identically worded error raised
 * anywhere else — and every protocol, authentication, configuration, or
 * non-recoverable initialization failure — stays actionable.
