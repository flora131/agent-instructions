/**
 * Mount options for the blocking questionnaire (#2378).
 *
 * The dialog used to mount inline, inside the fullscreen dock, where it is a
 * flex sibling of the transcript `ScrollView`. A tall side-by-side dialog then
 * took the transcript's rows: on a 40-row terminal the transcript viewport
 * collapsed from 34 rows to 6, and pi-tui derives its page step from that
 * viewport (`viewportHeight - PAGE_SCROLL_OVERLAP`), so PageUp crawled two
 * lines at a time through a six-line window.
 *
 * A bottom-anchored overlay is composited over the bottom rows instead of being
 * measured into the layout, so the transcript keeps its full viewport height
 * and its full page step. `reserveTranscriptRows` is what makes those rows
 * observable rather than merely addressable: the host bounds this overlay so a
 * transcript strip always survives, and extends the transcript's scroll extent
 * by the rows the overlay still covers, so the newest output can be raised into
 * that strip. No `maxHeight` — the host's bound is tighter, and letting pi-tui
 * slice as well would make the measured overlay height wrong.

The user can additionally type a custom answer ("Type something." row is appended automatically to single-select questions) or pick "Chat about this" to abandon the questionnaire.`,
		`Set multiSelect: true when multiple answers are valid; this suppresses the "Type something." row. Provide an options[].preview markdown string when an option benefits from richer side-by-side context (mockups, code snippets, diagrams, configs) — single-select only. NOTE: any non-empty preview on a single-select question ALSO suppresses the "Type something." row (no room in the side-by-side layout); "Chat about this" remains the escape hatch. If you recommend a specific option, make it the first option and append "(Recommended)" to its label.`,

1. Gather user preferences or requirements
2. Clarify ambiguous instructions
3. Get decisions on implementation choices as you work
4. Request confirmation, approval, or permission to proceed

Usage notes:
- Ask only for decisions that are needed; do not re-request existing authorization. State the exact action and scope, with explicit proceed and decline options for confirmations. A cancelled or unanswered question is not approval.
- If the tool or interactive UI is unavailable, do not substitute a plain-text question or infer permission. Continue already-authorized work where possible and report blocked actions.
- Users will always be able to type a custom answer ("Type something." row is appended automatically to every single-select question) or pick "Chat about this" to abandon the questionnaire and continue in free-form conversation. Do NOT author "Other" / "Type something." / "Chat about this" labels yourself — duplicates are rejected at runtime.
- Use multiSelect: true to allow multiple answers to be selected for a question. The "Type something." row is suppressed on multi-select questions, and is ALSO suppressed on single-select questions where any option carries a \`preview\` (the side-by-side layout has no room for inline custom text — "Chat about this" remains as the free-form escape hatch).
- If you recommend a specific option, make that the first option in the list and add "(Recommended)" at the end of the label.

Preview feature:
Use the optional \`preview\` field on options when presenting concrete artifacts that users need to visually compare:
- ASCII mockups of UI layouts or components
- Code snippets showing different implementations
- Diagram variations
- Configuration examples

Preview content is rendered as markdown in a monospace box. Multi-line text with newlines is supported. When any option has a preview, the UI switches to a side-by-side layout with a vertical option list on the left and preview on the right. Do not use previews for simple preference questions where labels and descriptions suffice. Note: previews are only supported for single-select questions (not multiSelect).`,
