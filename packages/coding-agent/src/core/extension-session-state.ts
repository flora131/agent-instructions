/**
 * Return the session-scoped state registered for `(scope, key)`, creating it
 * with `create` on first use.
 *
 * `scope` must be the extension's `pi.events` facade or the session EventBus
 * itself. It is resolved to its canonical EventBus first (see
 * {@link canonicalEventBusFor}), so every load generation of one session — each
 * holding a distinct `events` facade over the same bus — re-binds to the same
 * state, while two in-process sessions with distinct buses stay isolated.
 * Passing the bus itself works too: buses are fixed points of the resolution.
 *
 * The key namespace is session-wide, not per-extension. Two extensions that
 * pass the same key on the same session receive the same object; the later
 * factory is not called. Callers must prefix keys with a stable extension
 * identity and a version suffix (for example `"my-extension:state:v1"`).
 * Bumping the suffix declines an incompatible predecessor instead of reusing
 * it under a new shape.
 *
 * Entries live exactly as long as the bus they serve. They do not persist
 * across process restart; use `appendEntry` for durable session data.
