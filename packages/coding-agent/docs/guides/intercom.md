# Intercom

Intercom is a message channel between agent sessions running on the same machine. Sessions in the same group can send each other messages, ask questions and wait for an answer, and coordinate without going through you.

## When to use one

Use it when two sessions are working on related things and one knows something the other needs: a planner handing work to a worker, a long-running session reporting a finding, or steering a workflow stage while it runs. You do not need it for a single session working alone.

## What you get

- Send, ask-and-wait, and reply between live sessions in your group.
- Groups that keep unrelated sessions isolated from each other.
- Delivery to workflow stages, including stages that have not started yet.
