> Atomic can help you create workflows. Ask it to turn a repeatable process into a tracked multi-stage workflow.

# Workflows

Atomic uses workflows to run executable engineering loops: reusable multi-stage automation with tracked stages, parallel branches, artifacts, human input, live status, checkpoints, and resumable background execution.

Default to a workflow for non-trivial work with a verifiable objective — see [When to Use Workflows](#when-to-use-workflows) for the decision signals and exceptions, and [Choosing an Execution Shape](/workflows/reliable-design#choosing-an-execution-shape) for the execution shapes.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Tracked stages** - Name each step and inspect it in workflow status and graph views
- **Parallel branches** - Run independent research, review, or implementation branches concurrently
- **Context handoffs** - Pass summaries, artifacts, files, and schema-backed structured results between stages
- **Human input** - Pause for `ctx.ui.input`, `confirm`, `select`, `editor`, or custom TUI widget decisions during a run
- **Resumable control** - Pause, quit, resume, or connect to workflow runs
- **Intercom run notifications** - Deliver async run results and control notices (long-running, needs-attention, completed, failed) to a parent session over [Intercom](/intercom)
- **Artifacts** - Save large outputs to files instead of pushing everything through model context
- **Verification and gates** - Preserve evidence, run checks, and stop for human approval where reliability matters
- **Model fallback chains** - Retry important stages on fallback models when providers fail
- **Package distribution** - Ship workflows through Atomic packages, settings, or conventional directories

**Example use cases:**
- Well-defined autonomous jobs that benefit materially from durable execution state
- Long-running or background work with explicit completion criteria
- Codebase research with parallel local and external research stages
- Review/fix loops with independent reviewers and a synthesis stage
- Release planning with human approval gates
- Documentation audits that save findings as artifacts
- Multi-stage migrations, broad refactors, and validation/rollback plans
- Reusable team workflows distributed through npm, git, or project settings

## Choose your path

Start with battle-tested builtins. If no builtin fully fits the task, ask Atomic to design a dynamic, task-specific workflow. Hand-write and maintain custom workflow TypeScript after you are comfortable with Atomic, or when generated workflows do not meet the need. Generated and hand-written workflows use the same runtime definition; dynamic and custom describe the authoring progression, not incompatible runtime primitives.

Prefer composing builtin definitions with `ctx.workflow(...)` over copying or rebuilding their prompts, graphs, reducers, and gates.

1. [Builtins and dynamic workflows](/workflows/builtins) — choose a shipped workflow, then generate a task-specific definition when needed.
2. [Custom authoring](/workflows/authoring) — learn the TypeScript shape and build your first maintained workflow.
3. [Reliable design](/workflows/reliable-design) — design contracts, context, topology, gates, loops, and handoffs.
4. [Operations](/workflows/operations) — run, inspect, steer, pause, resume, and configure workflows.
5. [API reference](/workflows/api-reference) — look up definitions, contexts, options, results, and programmatic APIs.

## When to Use Workflows

Unless the user explicitly chooses inline execution, workflows are the default for non-trivial requests or structured work with a verifiable objective. Requests such as `quickly`, `inline`, `do this directly`, and `don't use a workflow` override that default for the specified task, even when complex. Treat "quickly" as an inline execution choice, not a request for a faster workflow. Do not launch a hidden/nested replacement or ask the user to reapprove the choice. Preserve testing, review, evidence, safety and authorization inline. Quoted examples, questions about inline code, and descriptions of software that should run quickly are not mode instructions. For an active switch, safely hold/stop the affected run and reconcile completed work and in-flight effects before continuing without duplicates; completed work is not undone. See [Verification and evidence](/workflows/verification).

When no opt-out was given, workflow signals include:

- implementation, build, debugging/diagnosis, bug-fix, migration, new-feature, scoped multi-file, or validated docs/code work
- multiple subtasks, dependencies, handoffs, uncertainty, or parallel/sequential stages
- review, validation, QA, approval, evidence, or human-input gates
- long-running or resumable background execution, saved artifacts, or important model fallback chains
- reusable automation or an explicit loop/stop condition (see the signal phrases below)

Loop or stop-condition phrasing is an especially strong workflow signal: `do X until Y`, `repeat until`, `iterate until`, `review/fix until passing`, `run checks and fix until green`, and `keep going until done` define control flow and convergence criteria that should be tracked.

Without an explicit mode preference, direct chat fits tiny, deterministic, low-risk answers or edits where tracking costs more than it adds. Once workflow fit is clear and workflow execution is permitted, keep reconnaissance bounded and put deeper research inside the run.

Workflow-first does not require builtins, monolithic workflows, or a force-fit builtin: a builtin that matches 60% of the task and fights the other 40% is worse than a small custom graph. Discover named builtin, project, user, and package workflows; or author a task-specific TypeScript `workflow({...})` inline with normal coding tools whenever the task needs richer branching, dynamic fan-out, artifacts, structured outputs, child workflows, human input, gates, retries, or loops.

Rich custom workflows can compose the [common workflow patterns](/workflows/reliable-design#common-workflow-patterns): classify and branch at runtime, fan out and synthesize artifacts, run worker/verifier/reducer repair cycles, generate and filter or tournament-rank candidates, and loop until explicit evidence says the work is done. Workflow definitions are composable TypeScript modules — see [Workflow Composition](/workflows/authoring#workflow-composition). Atomic can write the definition, reload workflow resources, and run it for the current task; the workflow tool has no create action.

Design for elapsed time using [runtime-aware scheduling and estimates](/workflows/reliable-design#runtime-aware-scheduling-and-estimates). Use available CI/test history to place focused checks at slice boundaries, defer redundant full-suite runs to the final candidate, and overlap independent work with CI without bypassing required gates. Before launch, report a completion range without confidence labels or scores. Inherit existing budget limits without asking for a budget choice before each launch, and override only limits the user explicitly requests. Preserve existing approval gates. An estimate is not a budget. At completion, compare the estimate with actual elapsed time.

If exploration drifts without progress, save findings and choose a concrete next action. Transfer them through `reads` to a fitting workflow when permitted; continue directly with appropriate validation when inline was requested.

| User need | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Run, inspect, connect to, pause, quit, resume, or check status for an existing workflow | `/workflow ...` or `workflow({ action: ... })` |
| Run repository-wide research | Compose `fan-out-and-synthesize` with repository-focused branches, artifact outputs, and a synthesis barrier, or author a smaller task-specific research workflow. |
| Run an implementation/review loop | Author a task-specific worker → fresh verifier → reducer loop with explicit evidence, repair bounds, and stop conditions. |
| Create or edit reusable automation | A TypeScript workflow definition exported from `workflow({...})` |
| Make a workflow robust | Design the stage graph, context handoffs, artifacts, validation gates, model fallbacks, and human approval points before coding |
