# Themes

Themes are JSON files that define colors for the TUI.

## On this page and its reference

This page covers selecting a theme and authoring your first one. The theme file format, every color token, and the accepted color values live in the [Theme reference](/themes/reference).

## Locations

Atomic loads themes from:

- Built-in: `dark`, `light`, `catppuccin-frappe`, `catppuccin-latte`, `catppuccin-macchiato`, `catppuccin-mocha`
- Global: `~/.atomic/agent/themes/*.json` (legacy `~/.pi/agent/themes/*.json`)
- Project: `.atomic/themes/*.json` (legacy `.pi/themes/*.json`, only after the project is trusted)
- Packages: `themes/` directories, `atomic.themes`, or legacy `pi.themes` entries in `package.json`
- Settings: `themes` array with files or directories
- CLI: `--theme <path>` (repeatable)

Disable discovery with `--no-themes`. `--theme <path>` loads a theme file; `--use-theme <name>` (see [Initial Theme](#initial-theme)) selects an already-loaded theme for this run without saving it.

## Selecting a Theme

Select a theme via `/settings` or in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "theme": "my-theme"
}
```

Use `"theme": "light-theme/dark-theme"` for automatic mode. Atomic chooses the first theme when the terminal reports a light color scheme and the second theme for dark terminals, and it follows terminal color-scheme changes when supported.

On first run, Atomic detects your terminal background and defaults to `dark` or `light`.

Main chat, attached workflow-stage chat, and the workflow graph canvas use the terminal's default background, including terminal transparency. Graph node interiors share that background; headers, footers, focused title tabs, and tool cards retain their theme colors.

Truncated workflow-node labels keep the focused tab's fill, text color, and weight through the ellipsis. The surrounding border and node body retain their own styling.

### Initial Theme

Start an interactive run with a theme without changing the saved setting:

```bash
atomic --use-theme light
```

To follow terminal appearance, use the `lightTheme/darkTheme` form:

```bash
atomic --use-theme light/dark
```

The CLI value is the initial theme for that run only. Choosing another theme later in `/settings` applies it immediately and saves it normally; an unknown theme name reports the ordinary theme error.

## Creating a Custom Theme

1. Create a theme file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.atomic/agent/themes
vim ~/.atomic/agent/themes/my-theme.json
```

2. Define the theme with all required colors (see [Color Tokens](/themes/reference#color-tokens)):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bastani-inc/atomic/main/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/theme/theme-schema.json",
  "name": "my-theme",
  "vars": {
    "primary": "#00aaff",
    "secondary": 242
  },
  "colors": {
    "accent": "primary",
    "border": "primary",
    "borderAccent": "#00ffff",
    "borderMuted": "secondary",
    "success": "#00ff00",
    "error": "#ff0000",
    "warning": "#ffff00",
    "muted": "secondary",
    "dim": 240,
    "text": "",
    "thinkingText": "secondary",
    "selectedBg": "#2d2d30",
    "scrollbarThumb": "#555566",
    "userMessageBg": "#2d2d30",
    "userMessageText": "",
    "customMessageBg": "#2d2d30",
    "customMessageText": "",
    "customMessageLabel": "primary",
    "toolPendingBg": "#1e1e2e",
    "toolSuccessBg": "#1e2e1e",
    "toolErrorBg": "#2e1e1e",
    "toolTitle": "primary",
    "toolOutput": "",
    "mdHeading": "#ffaa00",
    "mdLink": "primary",
    "mdLinkUrl": "secondary",
    "mdCode": "#00ffff",
    "mdCodeBlock": "",
    "mdCodeBlockBorder": "secondary",
    "mdQuote": "secondary",
    "mdQuoteBorder": "secondary",
    "mdHr": "secondary",
    "mdListBullet": "#00ffff",
    "toolDiffAdded": "#00ff00",
    "toolDiffRemoved": "#ff0000",
    "toolDiffContext": "secondary",
    "syntaxComment": "secondary",
    "syntaxKeyword": "primary",
    "syntaxFunction": "#00aaff",
    "syntaxVariable": "#ffaa00",
    "syntaxString": "#00ff00",
    "syntaxNumber": "#ff00ff",
    "syntaxType": "#00aaff",
    "syntaxOperator": "primary",
    "syntaxPunctuation": "secondary",
    "thinkingOff": "secondary",
    "thinkingMinimal": "primary",
    "thinkingLow": "#00aaff",
    "thinkingMedium": "#00ffff",
    "thinkingHigh": "#ff00ff",
    "thinkingXhigh": "#ff0000",
    "bashMode": "#ffaa00"
  }
}
```

3. Select the theme via `/settings`.

**Hot reload:** When you edit the currently active custom theme file, Atomic reloads it automatically for immediate visual feedback.

## Tips

**Dark terminals:** Use bright, saturated colors with higher contrast.

**Light terminals:** Use darker, muted colors with lower contrast.

**Color harmony:** Start with a base palette (Nord, Gruvbox, Tokyo Night), define it in `vars`, and reference consistently.

**Testing:** Check your theme with different message types, tool states, markdown content, and long wrapped text.

**VS Code:** Set `terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio` to `1` for accurate colors.
