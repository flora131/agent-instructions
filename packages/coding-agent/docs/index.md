# Atomic Documentation

Atomic is the loop engine for all engineering work: a terminal coding-agent runtime for reliable, inspectable engineering loops. It stays small at the core while being extended through TypeScript extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes, workflows, subagents, MCP, web access, and Atomic packages.

## Quick start

Install the published package globally with npm:

```bash
npm install -g @bastani/atomic
```

With pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -g @bastani/atomic
```

With Bun:

```bash
bun add -g @bastani/atomic
```

Package installation requires Node.js. Atomic does not require package install scripts; add `--ignore-scripts` if you want to disable dependency lifecycle scripts during a package install.

Alternatively, install the self-contained release archive, which needs no Node.js or package manager.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bastani-inc/atomic/main/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bastani-inc/atomic/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The archive installer verifies the GitHub Release checksum and installs the full payload under a versioned root. See the [Quickstart](/getting-started/installation#release-archive) for its parameters (`ATOMIC_VERSION`, `ATOMIC_INSTALL_DIR`, `ATOMIC_BIN_DIR`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`), default paths, and PATH guidance.

Then run it in a project directory:

```bash
atomic
```

Authenticate with `/login` for subscription providers, or set an API key such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before starting Atomic.

For the full first-run flow, see [Quickstart](/quickstart).

## Documentation paths

The documentation is organized by what you are trying to do, not by product area. Pick the path that matches your intent.

- **[Learn](/guides)** — install Atomic, run a first session, and get good at everyday use. Start with the [Quickstart](/quickstart) if you have never run Atomic, then read the [Guides](/guides).
- **[Build](/build)** — extend Atomic with prompt templates, skills, subagents, intercom, workflows, extensions, and packages, or embed it with [programmatic use](/programmatic).
- **[Reference](/reference)** — look up an exact command, flag, setting, event, method, type, or tool contract.

### First successful session

1. [Install Atomic](/getting-started/installation).
2. [Authenticate a provider](/getting-started/authentication).
3. [Start your first session](/getting-started/first-session).
4. [Add project instructions](/getting-started/project-instructions).
5. [Learn the interactive commands](/usage).
6. [Learn sessions](/sessions) and [context management](/compaction).
