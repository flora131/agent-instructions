# Model Selection

This page gives workflow authors and runtime policy code a practical way to answer:

- Which model should a workflow use by default?
- Which model should it use for judgment gates, debugging, planning, research, cheap worker loops, and fallback diversity?
- Which models are dominated on cost/accuracy and should be avoided unless they have a specific role fit?

It is a **static reference**. It does not change runtime model routing — routing is configured elsewhere. Treat these recommendations as a starting point and validate against your own workflow evals.

<Note>
The table below is a snapshot of the [DeepSWE](https://deepswe.datacurve.ai/) leaderboard (v1.1, highest published thinking level per model), a long-horizon coding-agent benchmark reporting `pass@1` and average dollars per task. The source reports 113 tasks and was updated September 3, 2026. DeepSWE's own default table view is **Best** — the best-scoring configuration per model — so four models show a different row there than the highest-effort row used here; the snapshot note below the table names them. Benchmarks and pricing drift and new models ship constantly, so **treat the live leaderboards as authoritative** and refresh this page from them rather than hand-maintaining scores. See [Evals](/models/evals). **Last compiled: 2026-09-03.**
</Note>

Artificial Analysis was reviewed separately on **2026-09-08** against its **September 7 Intelligence Index v4.3** revision. The DeepSWE table remains the September 3 snapshot and was not revalidated in this refresh; the earlier September 5 browser check confirmed its update date and Gemini 3.8 Flash row, not every configuration.

## Answering model-choice questions

For any task-specific model recommendation, not just workflow authoring, read the [task-type picker](/models/evals#pick-by-task-type) and its per-benchmark charts, then consult [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) for the relevant live evaluation and methodology. Recommend a task-fit candidate and explain the cost or latency tradeoff. Cite the benchmark version, retrieval date and exact model/effort configuration. An aggregate leaderboard winner is not a winner on every task.

If live results cannot be retrieved, use the dated docs snapshot and say it was not refreshed. Check the configured catalog before suggesting an exact provider/model ID or effort level; catalog presence does not prove live access. Keep benchmark measurement settings separate from production effort recommendations.

## Benchmark levels are measurement settings

The thinking level in brackets in the chart is the **measurement configuration used for that benchmark result**, not a universal workflow default. A score measured at `max` does not mean every stage using that model should use `max`; benchmark model identity and production thinking effort are separate choices. When authoring a workflow, choose effort from the stage role and cost of being wrong, then check the returned `availableThinkingLevels` for the configured catalog model.

In practice, `max` reasoning is usually overkill and is not the preferred workflow default. Start with `medium` for routine work and `high` for demanding analysis or coding, subject to catalog support. Treat `max` as an exception for high-cost-of-error judgments or an explicit user request, not a general quality upgrade. Compare task success, latency and cost on representative work before adopting it more broadly; a higher effort level does not guarantee a better result.

## Pin model identity

When a workflow needs an exact model, call `workflow({ action: "models" })` and pin a returned `fullId`. Do not pin a
bare model ID: the same exact model ID can belong to more than one provider. For a bare exact `--model` ID, Atomic
uses the sole matching provider with configured authentication; if none or more than one match is authenticated, it
reports the ambiguity. Use `--provider <provider> --model <id>` or `--model <provider>/<id>` to choose explicitly.

## AA cross-check for current candidates

These are selected candidates, not a replacement DeepSWE frontier. The [AA leaderboard](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) was retrieved **2026-09-08** under Intelligence Index **v4.3**, announced **2026-09-07**. Scores are index points, not pass percentages; cost is weighted USD per **AA Intelligence Index task**, not DeepSWE cost. Speed uses the default 10k-input workload in standardized output tokens per second, not full-task latency. The source has no separate publication timestamp for these measurements.

| Model and AA measurement configuration | Intelligence Index | AA $/task | Output tokens/s | Candidate role and tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Claude Fable 5.1, max with default fallback](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/claude-fable-5-1) | 53 | $7.63 | 69 | Knowledge-work planning candidate; xhigh also displays 53 at $5.98 per task |
| [GPT-6 Astra, max](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gpt-6-astra) | 53 | $3.26 | 62 | Terminal and document-reasoning candidate; xhigh displays 53 at $2.31 and scores higher on those two individual evaluations |
| [Gemini 3.8 Flash, high](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gemini-3-8-flash) | 41 | $1.24 | 286 | Strong historical Datacurve result, but only 20% on the new Terminal-Bench v4.0; check the intended task distribution |
| [GPT-5.6 Luna, max](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gpt-5-6-luna) | 38 | $0.18 | 121 | Budget long-context candidate with verification; 12% on Terminal-Bench v4.0 |

AA's [v4.3 announcement](https://artificialanalysis.ai/articles/artificial-analysis-intelligence-index-v4-3) replaces 𝜏³-Banking with AutomationBench-AA and Terminal-Bench v2.1 with v4.0. Fable 5.1 max with default fallback scores 58% normalized Elo on AA-Briefcase and 63% on GDPval-AA v2, versus Astra max at 53% and 54%. These are transformed Elo displays, **not pass rates**. Astra xhigh scores 32% GDP.pdf All-pass and 60% Terminal-Bench v4.0; Astra max scores 31% and 59%. Use the [per-evaluation tables](/models/evals#per-evaluation-scores-for-catalog-models) and [task-type picker](/models/evals#pick-by-task-type), not an aggregate rank. A rounded lead does not establish statistical significance, security-review reliability or the best model for every role. Fable's default-fallback result is not evidence for an arbitrary no-fallback configuration.

The separate [Coding Agent Index v1.4](https://artificialanalysis.ai/agents/coding-agents), retrieved 2026-09-08, still uses Terminal-Bench v2.1 alongside DeepSWE and SWE-Atlas-QnA. It reports Claude Code + Fable 5.1 max with fallback at **70**, **$9.18/task** and **24.0 minutes/task**, Opencode + Gemini 3.8 Flash high at **61**, **$2.04/task** and **11.9 minutes/task**, and Codex + Luna max at **57**, **$0.29/task** and **8.0 minutes/task**. These are named-agent runs, not Atomic or interchangeable base-model results. All fourteen rows are in [Evals](/models/evals#coding-agent-index-v14-is-a-different-comparison). Fable 5.1 remains absent from the separately dated Datacurve snapshot below.

## Recommendation chart

The current highest-effort-config Pareto frontier is **gemini-3.8-flash** (accuracy ceiling), **gpt-5.6-luna**, and **glm-5.3-flash** (cheapest point). It collapsed from five members to three when Gemini 3.8 Flash landed on September 1, 2026: at 73.83% unrounded it edges out claude-opus-5's 73.65% — both display 74% — for $2.36 against $11.84, which pushes claude-opus-5, gpt-5.6-sol, and glm-5.3 off the frontier. Everything else displayed on the live DeepSWE leaderboard is dominated on cost and accuracy and earns a place only through role fit or provider diversity. For the frontier reasoning, see [Pareto Efficiency](/models/pareto-efficiency).

| Model [benchmark measurement level] | pass@1 | $/task | Verdict | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gemini-3.8-flash [high] | 74% | $2.36 | Frontier — accuracy ceiling and best value | Judgment gates, hard debugging, and any role that wants top accuracy without top-tier cost; budget for 166 average steps and 143k output tokens per task |
| claude-opus-5 [max] | 74% | $11.84 | Dominated — top-tier role fit | Final approval and the hardest debugging when Anthropic-family behavior is specifically wanted; it matches Gemini 3.8 Flash's rounded 74% but costs $9.48 more per task |
| gpt-6-astra [max] | 73% | $12.37 | Dominated — new arrival | Added September 3, 2026 at DeepSWE's expected launch pricing rather than billed rates; its 28 average steps are the fewest of any row in this table, but Opus 5 scores higher for less |
| gpt-5.6-sol [max] | 73% | $6.46 | Near-peer, no longer on the frontier | High-cost judgment gates where OpenAI-family behavior is wanted; still about half Opus 5's task cost, but Gemini 3.8 Flash is more accurate at just over a third of Sol's task cost |
| gpt-5.6-terra [max] | 70% | $3.96 | Historical — outside the default selection | Last published measurement, re-verified unchanged in the September 3, 2026 artifact; DeepSWE deselects it by default, so re-enable it on the live page before relying on it |
| claude-fable-5 [max] | 70% | $21.63 | Drop | Sol matches or beats its score for much less, and Gemini 3.8 Flash is four rounded points better for about a ninth of the task cost |
| glm-5.3 [max] | 69% | $3.99 | Best open-weights value, off the frontier | Best open-weights mid-tier cost/accuracy point; matches Kimi K3's rounded score for less, though Gemini 3.8 Flash is five rounded points better for $1.63 less |
| kimi-k3 [max] | 69% | $4.65 | Dominated | GLM-5.3 matches its rounded score for $0.66 less; Moonshot-family diversity only |
| gpt-5.6-luna [max] | 67% | $0.61 | Frontier — cheapest broadly-capable point | Research, orchestration, workers, and code simplification |
| gpt-5.5 [xhigh] | 67% | $7.23 | Superseded | Luna matches its score for less than one tenth of the task cost |
| grok-4.6 [xhigh] | 67% | $5.50 | Provider fallback | xAI diversity; Luna has the same rounded score at lower DeepSWE task cost |
| gemini-3.7-flash [high] | 65% | $2.18 | Provider fallback | Strong Google-family result, but Luna is cheaper and more accurate, and Gemini 3.8 Flash supersedes it inside the Google family at 74% for $2.36 |
| glm-5.3-flash [max] | 63% | $0.24 | Frontier — cheapest | Budget worker loops that can accept lower accuracy and 123 average steps |
| deepseek-v4-pro [max] | 63% | $1.67 | Dominated / provider fallback | DeepSeek diversity only; GLM-5.3 Flash has a higher unrounded score, fewer steps, and about one seventh of the cost |
| claude-opus-4.8 [max] | 59% | $13.22 | Fallback only | Anthropic diversity and long-context behavior, not cost efficiency |
| qwen3.8-max [xhigh] | 57% | $3.73 | Provider fallback | Qwen diversity only; GLM-5.3 Flash and Luna dominate it |
| muse-spark-1.2 [xhigh] | 55% | $3.70 | Drop | GLM-5.3 Flash is cheaper and more accurate |
| claude-sonnet-5 [max] | 54% | $26.40 | Drop everywhere | Highest task cost and 268 average steps for a mid-table score |
| grok-4.5 [high] | 54% | $2.42 | Historical — outside the default selection | Last published measurement, re-verified unchanged; superseded by Grok 4.6 and dominated by current frontier models |
| deepseek-v4-flash [max] | 53% | $0.46 | Dominated / provider fallback | DeepSeek diversity only; GLM-5.3 Flash is ten points more accurate for about half the cost |
| muse-spark-1.1 [xhigh] | 53% | $2.36 | Historical — outside the default selection | Last published measurement, re-verified unchanged; replaced by Muse Spark 1.2 and dominated by current frontier models |
| gpt-5.4 [xhigh] | 52% | $5.65 | Historical — outside the default selection | Last published measurement, re-verified unchanged; Luna is cheaper and 15 points more accurate |
| gemini-3.6-flash [high] | 47% | $2.21 | Drop from reasoning | Superseded by Gemini 3.7 Flash |
| glm-5.2 [max] | 44% | $3.92 | Superseded | Measured predecessor only; do not relabel this as GLM-5.3 |
| gemini-3.5-flash [high] | 36% | $3.45 | Drop from reasoning | Retain only where a low-effort retrieval role has separate evidence |
| kimi-k2.7-code | 31% | $2.82 | Historical — outside the default selection | Last published measurement had no effort level; Kimi K3 is the current family fallback |
| claude-sonnet-4.6 [high] | 30% | $5.52 | Historical — outside the default selection | Last published measurement, re-verified unchanged; removed from all chains |
| gemini-3.1-pro-preview [high] | 12% | $2.14 | Historical — outside the default selection | Last published measurement, re-verified unchanged; the live page labels it `gemini-3.1-pro`; removed from all chains |

<Note>
DeepSWE values above use the v1.1 results published in the September 3, 2026 snapshot, including the August 21 pricing corrections for GPT-5.6 Sol and DeepSeek V4. Sol's cost reflects OpenAI's promotional input and output price cut through at least November 21, 2026. DeepSWE uses DeepSeek's peak rates; its off-peak rates are half as much. GPT-6 Astra's DeepSWE costs are expected-launch-pricing estimates rather than billed rates; that caveat does not describe the separately sourced AA costs above. `pass@1` is rounded as on the live leaderboard and confidence intervals are omitted here — but note that the top of the board is a cluster: the top three rows span less than a point unrounded, well inside DeepSWE's published run-to-run intervals, so read a one-row lead as a tie. The highest published thinking level is a measurement choice, not a production default, and DeepSWE's own data shows effort saturation: for GPT-6 Astra, Claude Fable 5, Grok 4.6, and Gemini 3.7 Flash the best-scoring configuration is *not* the highest one. That is why DeepSWE's default "Best" table view displays four rows this table does not: `gpt-6-astra [xhigh]` at 74% for $6.52 with 29 average steps, `claude-fable-5 [xhigh]` at 70% for $13.41, `grok-4.6 [medium]` at 67% for $3.45, and `gemini-3.7-flash [medium]` at 65% for $2.03. Seven measured configurations are retained here with their last published values because DeepSWE excludes them from its default model selection, not because they were withdrawn; each was re-verified unchanged against the September 3, 2026 artifact and can be re-enabled in the site's model picker: GPT-5.6 Terra, Grok 4.5, Muse Spark 1.1, GPT-5.4, Kimi K2.7 Code, Claude Sonnet 4.6, and Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview. Atomic now ships GPT-6 Astra through its built-in OpenAI, OpenAI Codex, and Amazon Bedrock catalogs. A benchmark row still does not prove that the current account has provider access, so run `workflow({ action: "models" })` or `--list-models` before pinning Astra or another catalog model. See the live page for intervals, output tokens, steps, lower-effort configurations, and later corrections.

<Note>
**Claude Fable 5.1 is in Atomic's catalog and is not in the DeepSWE table above.** It was released September 1, 2026 and is absent from the September 3, 2026 Datacurve DeepSWE snapshot, so it has no measured `pass@1` or `$/task` in that snapshot. It does have AA Intelligence Index and Coding Agent Index measurements, described above. Do not read the `claude-fable-5` row as a Fable 5.1 result or transfer its score. Evaluate Fable 5.1 on your own workflow before promoting it into a stage.

What is source-backed for `claude-fable-5-1` today, from [Anthropic's model overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/models/fable-5-1/overview): a 1M-token context window and 128K maximum output; adaptive thinking that is always on, with effort `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` and an Anthropic default of `high`; a June 2026 knowledge cutoff; and $10 input, $50 output, $12.50 five-minute cache write, $20 one-hour cache write, and $0.25 cache read per million tokens. The cache read is a quarter of Fable 5's $1.00, which is the main pricing reason to prefer it for long agentic sessions that re-read a cached prefix. Non-default `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` return a 400 on every request, so Atomic omits `temperature` for this model.

Atomic generates Fable 5.1 for the providers it has a matching runtime integration for. At the time of writing that is Anthropic, GitHub Copilot, three Amazon Bedrock inference profiles (`anthropic.`, `global.`, and `us.`), OpenRouter, and the Vercel AI Gateway. GitHub Copilot includes Fable 5 and Fable 5.1 in its static catalog from models.dev metadata, but its authenticated picker still decides which models each account may select. A provider "latest" alias such as OpenRouter's `~anthropic/claude-fable-latest` may also route to Fable 5.1 without naming it. That set genuinely moves — opencode zen published the model and then withdrew it while this page was being written — so run `workflow({ action: "models" })` or `--list-models` for the current list rather than trusting this one. Published catalogs also list the model on Google Vertex, Google Vertex (Anthropic), Azure, and Azure Cognitive Services; Atomic has no Claude runtime integration for those providers and generates no entries for them, which is a current limitation rather than a roadmap commitment. What does *not* vary is the invariant that matters: **Atomic's preserved-thinking handling is scoped to `provider: "anthropic"` on the `anthropic-messages` API and applies to none of the other mirrors** — including GitHub Copilot and the Vercel AI Gateway, which ride `anthropic-messages` but are deliberately excluded. See [Preserved thinking and model switches](/models#preserved-thinking-and-model-switches).
</Note>

<Note>
**Gemini 3.8 Flash is in Atomic's catalog and is measured in the DeepSWE table above.** A separate read of [Datacurve's rendered leaderboard](https://deepswe.datacurve.ai/) on **2026-09-05** confirmed its September 3, 2026 snapshot and the `gemini-3.8-flash [high]` row at **74% pass@1, $2.36/task, 143k output tokens and 166 steps**. These are its own measurements, not Gemini 3.7 Flash's. Its AA measurements above are a separate experiment, and neither benchmark proves access through your configured provider.

For `gemini-3.8-flash`, [Google's model page](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/gemini/3-8-flash) and [developer's guide](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/guides/gemini-3-8-flash), both updated September 3 and retrieved 2026-09-05, report a 1,048,576-token context window, 65,536 maximum output tokens, multimodal input with text output, and thinking levels `low`, `medium`, and `high`. The [September 2 model card](https://deepmind.google/models/model-cards/gemini-3-8-flash/), retrieved 2026-09-05, states a March 2026 knowledge cutoff, with some domains limited to January 2025. AA's model page above lists $0.75 input and $3.75 output per million tokens; Google's published cache-read rate is $0.075. These are token prices, not the measured task costs above. Atomic advertises `text` and `image` input because those are the inputs it can serialize on the Gemini path. Thinking cannot be turned off, and Google's guide states that `MINIMAL` is unsupported, so the Google, Google Vertex, and opencode zen entries offer `low`, `medium`, and `high`. Google stopped publishing `MINIMAL` from Gemini 3.7 Flash onward; Atomic's 3.7 Flash entries still offer it, which is a separate pre-existing gap.

Atomic generates entries only from the upstream provider catalogs it supports, so the exact provider set and metadata can change. Run `workflow({ action: "models" })` or `--list-models` for the current result. The current models.dev GitHub Copilot row advertises a 1,000,000-token context window, 64,000 maximum output tokens, and `low`, `medium`, and `high` reasoning efforts. Atomic consumes that row without supplementing or overriding it and routes it through Copilot's OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Copilot availability still depends on GitHub's rollout and administrator policy. The Vercel AI Gateway currently advertises a 1,000,000-token context window and no per-model thinking levels, so its entry offers `off` and `minimal` alongside the three Google levels.
</Note>

## Role-based thinking effort

Use this table when the user has not requested a thinking level. It is a production default by stage role, not a claim about the level used by any benchmark row:

| Stage role | Default thinking level | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security, identity, adversarial challenge, final approval | `max` | A wrong judgment can create a high-risk false approval or waste a full downstream loop. |
| Codebase mapping, lifecycle analysis, compatibility, planning, synthesis, triage, repair | `high` | These stages must resolve demanding uncertainty and preserve evidence across handoffs; routine synthesis may use `medium` when evidence quality holds. |
| User-impact review and final reporting | `medium` | Clear evidence-backed summaries usually do not need the deepest reasoning. |
| Deterministic checks | No model call | Run typechecks, tests, schema checks, runtime probes, and artifact checks as durable tool nodes. |

Reserve `max` for a high-cost-of-error role or an explicit user request. An explicit request wins over this role default, but the requested level still must appear in the configured catalog; do not invent an unsupported suffix. For each primary and fallback, choose a level for the same stage role independently. A fallback is not a reason to inherit `max` mechanically: use the role default at a supported level, choose another catalog model when needed, or leave the stage unpinned rather than guessing.

## Scenario-based guidance

Pick by the cost of being wrong in each role, not by raw accuracy. The AA evidence below was read on 2026-09-08; the Datacurve evidence remains the September 3 snapshot. See [Evals](/models/evals) for measurement settings, normalized Elo versus pass-rate units and source links.

- **Reviewer / judgment gates.** Use `max` for a high-cost-of-error security, identity, adversarial or final-approval decision, subject to the configured model's supported efforts. No external benchmark here establishes security-review reliability. Claude Code + Fable 5.1 max with fallback and Claude Code + Opus 5 xhigh score 56% and 55% on SWE-Atlas-QnA, versus 51% for Codex + Astra max, but those harness-specific results need validation in Atomic.
- **Codebase mapping / planner.** Start at `high`. For knowledge-work deliverables, Fable 5.1 max with fallback scores 58% normalized Elo on AA-Briefcase, Opus 5 max 57%, and GLM-5.3-Flash 48% at $0.25 per Index task. These are candidates, not measured repository-planning pass rates. Raise effort only for the role's cost of error or the user's request.
- **Debugger / triage / repair.** Start at `high`. The new Terminal-Bench v4.0 is no longer flat near 90%: Astra xhigh scores 60%, Fable 5.1 xhigh with fallback 55%, Opus 5 max 49%, and Gemini 3.8 Flash high 20%. Keep Datacurve cost and steps as separate evidence; do not transfer its 74% Gemini result into this benchmark.
- **Research / synthesis.** Use `high` for demanding reconciliation and `medium` for routine synthesis. Luna max scores 84% on AA-LCR at $0.18 per Index task, but its 7% non-hallucination rate counts partial answers or not attempted among non-correct responses, not all answers. Verify factual claims. Astra xhigh leads the displayed GDP.pdf rows at 32%; GLM-5.3-Flash and GLM-5.3 max score 72% and 70% non-hallucination.
- **Orchestrator / worker / cheap loops.** Use AutomationBench-AA for SaaS tool workflows: Astra max 68%, GLM-5.3-Flash 60%, Luna max 50%. GLM-5.3-Flash and Luna remain budget candidates on the separately dated Datacurve frontier. Gemini 3.8 Flash's 166 steps and 143k output tokens in that snapshot argue against choosing workers on pass rate alone. Validate the tradeoff on the actual workflow.
- **User-impact review / final reporting** — use `medium` for impact summaries and reports that preserve the evidence needed by the user. Do not spend `max` here unless the user explicitly requests it or the role has become a high-cost-of-error approval.
- **Design** — a quality-first domain not directly measured by these coding tables. Choose effort by the review or approval role. Fable 5.1's AA-Briefcase results make it a candidate for knowledge-work deliverables, not proof of product-design quality; evaluate it on the intended design tasks and do not carry Fable 5's DeepSWE row over to it.
- **Interactive coding sessions** — use `high` for complex, multi-step coding and `medium` for routine edits; reserve `max` for a high-cost-of-error judgment or an explicit user request.
- **Deterministic checks** — make typechecks, tests, schema validation, runtime probes, and artifact inspection tool nodes with no model call. Model self-report is not verification evidence.
