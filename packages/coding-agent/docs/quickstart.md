# Quickstart

**Outcome:** Atomic is installed, authenticated, and has completed one useful task in your repository.

This page gets you from install to a useful first Atomic session. Atomic is the loop engine for all engineering work: it runs reliable coding-agent loops with stages, tools, artifacts, verification, subagents, review gates, checkpoints, and human approvals.

It is the ordered onboarding hub: each step below links to a focused page that carries the full detail. Work through them in order.

## Onboarding path

1. **[Install Atomic](/getting-started/installation)** — package manager or self-contained release archive.
2. **[Authenticate](/getting-started/authentication)** — subscription login or API key.
3. **[Run your first session](/getting-started/first-session)** — start Atomic, run a task, invoke a built-in workflow, and steer the run.
4. **[Add project instructions](/getting-started/project-instructions)** — teach Atomic your repository's conventions with `AGENTS.md`.

Then come back here for [common things to try](#common-things-to-try) and [next steps](#next-steps).

## Prerequisites

- **Package install:** Node.js 22.19 or newer plus npm, pnpm, Yarn, or Bun. Use Bun 1.4.2+ for Bun installs or workflow-authoring examples.
- **Release archive install:** macOS and Linux need `tar` and either `curl` or `wget`; Windows uses built-in PowerShell commands. This path does not need Node.js or a package manager.
- **Model-provider access** — use a supported subscription login or API key. Run `/login` after startup.

Full detail: `AGENTS.md` discovery, precedence, and what to put in it.

## Common things to try

### Reference files

Type `@` in any interactive editor to fuzzy-search files; or pass files on the command line:

```bash
atomic @README.md "Summarize this"
atomic @src/app.ts @src/app.test.ts "Review these together"
```

Images can be pasted with native macOS Cmd+V, Ctrl+V (Alt+V on Windows), or dragged into supported terminals. Inside tmux on macOS, use `Ctrl+V` for reliable image paste; native `Cmd+V` depends on terminal forwarding. VS Code's terminal may forward the empty bracketed-paste route through tmux, while Ghostty may not forward its Kitty `super+v` route through tmux. When the clipboard has both text and an image, Ctrl+V prefers the image; Cmd+V may paste text or the image depending on how the terminal delivers the gesture.

### Run shell commands

In interactive mode:

```text
!bun run lint
```

The command output is sent to the model. Use `!!command` to run a command without adding its output to the model context.

### Switch models

Use `/model` or CTRL+L to choose a model. Use SHIFT+Tab to cycle thinking level. Use CTRL+P / SHIFT+CTRL+P to cycle through scoped models.

### Continue later

Sessions are saved automatically:

```bash
atomic -c                  # Continue most recent session
atomic -r                  # Browse previous sessions
atomic --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
atomic --session <path|id> # Open a specific session
```

Inside Atomic, use `/resume`, `/new`, `/tree`, `/fork`, and `/clone` to manage sessions.

### Non-interactive mode

For one-shot prompts:

```bash
atomic -p "Summarize this codebase"
cat README.md | atomic -p "Summarize this text"
atomic -p @screenshot.png "What's in this image?"
```

Use `--mode json` for JSON event output or `--mode rpc` for process integration.

## Next steps

- [Using Atomic](/usage) - interactive mode, slash commands, sessions, context files, and CLI reference.
- [Workflows](/workflows) - run, inspect, and author multi-stage automation (including the built-in workflows).
- [Skills](/skills) - reusable expert instructions invoked with `/skill:<name>`.
- [Providers](/providers) - authentication and model setup.
- [Settings](/settings) - global and project configuration.
- [Keybindings](/keybindings) - shortcuts and customization.
- [Atomic Packages](/packages) - install shared extensions, skills, prompts, and themes.
- [Security](/security) - project trust, what Atomic is allowed to touch, and how to report a vulnerability. Read this before you trust a project or install someone else's skills, extensions, or packages.
- [Containerization](/containerization) - run Atomic or its tools inside an isolated environment.

Platform notes: [Windows](/windows), [Termux](/termux), [tmux](/tmux), [Terminal setup](/terminal-setup), [Shell aliases](/shell-aliases).
