# SDK

The SDK provides programmatic access to atomic's agent capabilities. Use it to embed atomic in other applications, build custom interfaces, or integrate with automated workflows.

**Example use cases:**
- Build a custom UI (web, desktop, mobile)
- Integrate agent capabilities into existing applications
- Create automated pipelines with agent reasoning
- Build custom tools that spawn sub-agents
- Test agent behavior programmatically

See [examples/sdk/](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/tree/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk) for working examples from minimal to full control.

## Owner-bound task supervisor (S1)

S1 adds an SDK-only task foundation in `src/core/tasks/contracts.ts` and
`src/core/tasks/supervisor.ts`, backed by the native `TaskSupervisor`. It is an
internal trusted-host integration surface, not a package-root export or a new CLI
command. Existing subagent runners, workflow execution, bash/PTY and task UI do
not use it yet.

A host binds its actual session or workflow-stage scope with `bindHostSession`,
provides launch authorization and a runner factory, then calls `openTaskOwner`.
Authorization runs before native admission. `startAgentTask` registers an agent
task before runner setup and returns its lease without waiting for completion.
Exact operation replay reuses that task and execution; a fresh operation creates
a distinct task. Leases are environment-local capabilities, cannot be serialized,
and cannot be reconstructed from task IDs or historical records.

`initialObservation` applies launch policy: omitted policy yields
`default-background`, explicit background yields `explicit`, and foreground
registers a wait with its requested budget. A ready terminal result wins.
`await waitForTask(task, budgetMs?, designation?)` and
`await foregroundTask(task, budgetMs?)` return a Result containing a WaitOutcome,
not a lease. Native registration and the WaitId registry are populated synchronously
before either door awaits. Host lifecycle actions can use `findWait(waitId)` to
yield or dispose a registered observation; ordinary callers need no extra observe call.
SDK waits do not replace the host designation unless given a matching HostSession.
An elapsed/explicit yield or observer disposal never stops or relaunches execution;
a later yield of a disposed wait replays its ObserverCancelled Result.

Requested agent waits default to 30000 ms. Supply owner-host settings through
`bindHostSession({ scope, tasks: { wait: { kind: "automatic", agentBudgetMs: 5000 } },
authorizeLaunch, createRunner })`; `{ kind: "until-settled" }` disables timed yielding.
Per-call budgets override settings, including zero for immediate yield. These settings
apply to explicit foreground-first launch, live foregrounding and task-ID waits,
never to a default independent launch. Wide numeric budgets are not narrowed to u32.
Accepted `NaN` budgets (including configured `agentBudgetMs`) do not panic native
scheduling. The implementation leaves such observations pending until explicit yield,
settlement, observer disposal or owner closure: the elapsed comparison never reaches
`NaN`. It uses bounded sleep chunks without rewriting the caller's budget. This is
scheduling behavior, not a new finite-only input restriction or an RFC-mandated deadline;
other numeric budgets and per-call precedence are unchanged.

`await cancelTask(task, cause)` returns a Result containing a cancellation receipt
and preserves the first accepted cause. `closeTaskOwner` seals admission before
draining and succeeds only after independent cleanup acknowledgement. The trusted
runner supplies separate result and cleanup promises: confirmed reaping after
cancellation can close even if no result arrives. Natural cleanup-first delivery
waits for its outcome before acknowledging reaping. External native owner closure
also aborts resources attached to already-settled results without rewriting them.
Failed cleanup remains observable; absent acknowledgement can leave close pending.
User cancellation retains pending input attention until settlement or owner closure;
event-reduced and reattached snapshots report the same native facts. Runner result
rejections become failed `RunnerFailed` results; cleanup rejections become diagnostic
`CleanupFailed` resources, never successful reaping. Setup throws retain `SpawnFailed`
and unconfirmed cleanup. Strings and Error messages are preserved verbatim; other JS
values use safe string conversion, with `Unprintable JavaScript rejection` if conversion
throws. Cancelled cleanup still does not depend on the result promise settling.
This slice exercises fake runners, not force-stop or real-process cleanup guarantees.

### Supervised command SDK

`startCommandTask(owner, intent, operation)` starts an owned Unix pipe/PTY or Windows pipe command.
The command intent keeps execution timeout separate from observation: `waitForTask`
defaults to 10000 ms for commands, and expiry returns a yielded observation without
terminating the process. On Unix, owner closure sends TERM, allows 250 ms grace, then KILL,
reaps the leader and confirms process-group exit and reader drain. A cleanup failure
retains diagnostics instead of claiming a closed owner. This is normal owner/host
shutdown cleanup, not a guarantee for forced host death or a blocked JavaScript loop.

`taskStdin(task)` returns a non-serializable stdin capability. `writeTaskInput` takes
an operation ID and `{kind:"bytes", bytes:Uint8Array}` or `{kind:"eof"}`. Empty bytes
are a no-op. Input has 65536 byte credits, refuses excess input before admission,
and replays recorded receipts without resending bytes. Ambiguous partial delivery
returns `InputDeliveryUnknown`, including operation ID and known accepted-byte count.

`readTaskOutput(task, {start, maximumBytes})` returns owned byte chunks at decimal
offsets, requested bounds, omitted ranges and an optional next offset. It does not
sanitize or normalize bytes. Retention uses a 1 MiB live head/tail, 8 MiB foreground
spill threshold and 5 GiB disk cap. Retained output is not conversation history.
Background file-spool commands are checked every five seconds after foreground
collection yields. Exceeding the cap kills the group and settles `OutputLimitExceeded`.
Drained pipe/PTY output instead keeps running with bounded retained bytes and omissions.
PTY resize uses the retained portable-pty master. Windows pipe commands use a
suspended `cmd.exe` launch assigned to a kill-on-close Job Object before resume.
Failed assignment terminates and waits for the suspended process; unconfirmed
cleanup retains a failed resource rather than reporting it reaped. Windows PTY
and owner-aware Windows bash transport are not implemented and refuse with
`ContainmentUnavailable` before launch. Legacy unowned execution is unchanged.

Bash tools and `createLocalBashOperations` accept a trusted `taskOwner` binding.
On Unix, that binding obtains pipe/PTY processes through supervised admission,
preserving configured shell arguments, cwd, environment and existing authorization.
The foreground collection returns a yielded task observation after 10000 ms;
the process stays owned and its retained output remains readable. Without that
binding, existing bash and native PTY execution are unchanged. No UI is added.

`watchOwnerTasks(owner, cursor?)` provides an opaque `lease`, snapshot,
decimal-string cursor and disposable `AsyncIterable<NativeEvent>`. Each iterator
observes one contiguous delivery epoch. On local backlog overflow or native journal
reset, the subscription updates its authoritative `snapshot` and `cursor`, discards
stale queued deltas, and completes the old iterator (`next()` returns `done:true`,
including an already-pending read). This also works when an oversized final settlement
leaves no retained event, without later activity or cleanup. No synthetic reset event
is inserted and the `NativeEvent` and subscription types are unchanged.

After any iterator completion, reconcile `subscription.snapshot` at
`subscription.cursor`. If the owner is still live and observation is still wanted,
obtain another iterator from the **same** `subscription.events`; the old iterator stays
done. Reset does not dispose the subscription or close the owner. Subsequent deltas
are authentic and ordered; ignore events at or below an already-applied snapshot
cursor. Explicit `dispose()` (idempotent) or breaking out of a live iterator ends
observation, not the owner. Owner closure also ends delivery. Track your own disposal
when deciding whether to resume. New subscriptions are refused once owner closing
begins; existing subscriptions continue through cleanup/closure.

The optional `subscription.onReconcile` callback is a convenience, not required for
correctness; callback exceptions remain visible as `subscription.failure`. Raw strings
and Error messages are preserved; unprintable values (including hostile conversion or
revoked proxies) use `Unprintable JavaScript rejection`. Diagnostic conversion cannot
interrupt event delivery or rearming the fallback poll. Native callbacks are wake hints;
journal drains and reset snapshots are authoritative. Each live subscription has one
fallback poll, stopped on disposal or observed closure.
The native byte journal and facade delivery backlog are bounded. Each task separately
retains its most recent 256 accepted activity report IDs, SHA-256 payload hashes and
receipts (`TASK_REPORT_IDENTITY_WINDOW`). Within that window, identical payloads return
`duplicate` with the original cursor; conflicting payloads return `ReportConflict`.
Neither check emits events or refreshes retention order. An evicted ID is fresh: while
the task is live it is `accepted`, applies its activity again and gets a new cursor;
existing terminal and owner-close guards still apply. Terminal outcome reports and
their recorded receipts are retained separately for the task record's lifetime and
never evicted by activity churn. This bounds identity entry count, not caller ID length,
task count, terminal payloads or total task-history memory. S1 adds no persistence layer.

Activity IDs have no reserved spellings, including `runner-outcome`, empty strings
and isolated surrogates. The facade submits its own result through private trusted
runner support: the actor selects a free terminal identity and accepts the outcome
under the same lock. With at most 256 retained activity IDs, at most 257 distinct
candidates suffice; selection emits no events and retains no extra ID history.
Caller-supplied reports still use the unchanged `reportTaskOutcome` contract:
same-ID cross-kind reports conflict, and terminal replay retains its original receipt.
The internal support also reuses an accepted terminal identity, so a different result
cannot replace it; cancellation-first still rejects late natural outcomes. Normal,
rejected and setup-failure results all use this path without bypassing cleanup evidence.

Caller-provided strings retain their exact JavaScript UTF-16 code units, including
isolated surrogates, valid pairs and embedded NUL, across scopes, intent, operation/report
identity, activity, results and nested output/cleanup metadata. They remain ordinary
`string` fields, not encoded wrappers. Replacing a surrogate with U+FFFD is a changed
payload or identity, never an exact replay. Nonempty descriptions supply the title;
otherwise the first nonblank task line is copied without rewriting its code units,
falling back to the agent name. Absent optional fields, empty strings, known zero metrics
and ordered duplicate data remain distinct. The optional `elapsedMs`, `toolCount` and `tokenCount` metrics and
completed/failed `exitCode` preserve JavaScript numbers without narrowing or normalization,
including fractional and extreme values. Within the retained activity window (and for
terminal reports throughout the task record's lifetime), exact replay distinguishes
omission, zero and negative zero; repeated NaN and infinite values acknowledge once.
Changed numeric payloads return `ReportConflict` without earning another event. `OutputRef` is
metadata, not proof of retained bytes: output
storage, `readTaskOutput`, command input, persistence, completion delivery and
real agent/Intercom integration belong to later slices. The credential-free
repository fixture `test/fixtures/task-s1-demo.ts` exercises this real facade and
native actor with one fake runner.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, ModelRuntime, SessionManager } from "@bastani/atomic";

const modelRuntime = await ModelRuntime.create();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  modelRuntime,
});

session.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === "message_update" && event.assistantMessageEvent.type === "text_delta") {
    process.stdout.write(event.assistantMessageEvent.delta);
  }
});

await session.prompt("What files are in the current directory?");
```

`ModelRuntime` is the canonical asynchronous provider runtime when an integration wants provider-owned credentials, dynamic catalogs, and native providers in one object:

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, ModelRuntime, SessionManager } from "@bastani/atomic";

const modelRuntime = await ModelRuntime.create();
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  modelRuntime,
});
```

`ModelRuntime.create()` accepts custom `authPath`, `modelsPath`, credential storage, and runtime auth overrides, plus the model-catalog options `allowModelNetwork`, `modelRefreshTimeoutMs`, `modelsStorePath`, and `modelsStore` (see [Model catalog persistence and refresh](#model-catalog-persistence-and-refresh)). `ModelRegistry` and `AuthStorage` remain available as Atomic's synchronous compatibility facades. Use `readStoredCredential(provider, authPath?)` for a lightweight read of one stored provider credential.

Extensions supplied directly to SDK sessions can use the exported `InlineExtension` type. Extension APIs and event types include native `registerProvider(Provider)`, `registerEntryRenderer`, `entry_appended`, `before_provider_headers`, and `agent_settled`.

The package root also exports `buildContextEntries`, `sessionEntryToContextMessages`, and `CompactionEntry` for converting durable session branches into model context. The equivalent active-session operation is `sessionManager.buildContextEntries()`.

## Installation

Install `@bastani/atomic` as a project dependency with npm, pnpm, or Bun:

With npm:

```bash
npm install @bastani/atomic
```

With pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @bastani/atomic
```

With Bun:

```bash
bun add @bastani/atomic
```

Atomic does not require package install scripts. If you want to disable dependency lifecycle scripts during the Atomic install, you can add `--ignore-scripts` to the install command.

The SDK is included in the main package. No separate SDK package is needed.

## Pi client

`@bastani/atomic/client` re-exports `@earendil-works/pi-client`. Pi 0.85 replaced the experimental `RemoteSession` lease API with its service-addressed Chord client; use the upstream client and agent service APIs for remote sessions.

## Core Concepts

### createAgentSession()

The main factory function for a single `AgentSession`.

`createAgentSession()` uses a `ResourceLoader` to supply extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes, and context files. If you do not provide one, it uses `DefaultResourceLoader` with normal user, project, and configured-package discovery. The SDK does not add optional bundled workflow, subagent, MCP, or web-access extensions by default. It always adds the lightweight ordinary Intercom extension at the model-session boundary.

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, SessionManager } from "@bastani/atomic";

// Minimal: defaults with DefaultResourceLoader
const { session } = await createAgentSession();

// Custom: override specific options
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  model: myModel,
  tools: ["read", "bash"],
  // Or keep defaults and remove specific tools:
  // excludedTools: ["ask_user_question"],
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
});
```

### AgentSession

The session manages agent lifecycle, message history, model state, compaction, and event streaming.

```typescript
interface AgentSession {
  // Send a prompt and wait for completion
  prompt(text: string, options?: PromptOptions): Promise<void>;

  // Queue messages during streaming
  steer(text: string): Promise<void>;
  followUp(text: string): Promise<void>;

  // Controlled queue-pause gate
  readonly queuedMessagesPaused: boolean;
  pauseQueuedMessages(): void;
  resumeQueuedMessages(): Promise<boolean>;

  // Subscribe to events (returns unsubscribe function)
  subscribe(listener: (event: AgentSessionEvent) => void): () => void;

  // Session info
  sessionFile: string | undefined;
  sessionId: string;

  // Model and thinking control
  setModel(model: Model): Promise<void>;
  setThinkingLevel(level: ThinkingLevel): void;
  cycleModel(): Promise<ModelCycleResult | undefined>;
  cycleThinkingLevel(): ThinkingLevel | undefined;

  // State access
  agent: Agent;
  model: Model | undefined;
  thinkingLevel: ThinkingLevel;
  messages: AgentMessage[];
  isStreaming: boolean;

  // In-place tree navigation within the current session file
  navigateTree(targetId: string, options?: { summarize?: boolean; customInstructions?: string; replaceInstructions?: boolean; label?: string }): Promise<{ editorText?: string; cancelled: boolean; aborted?: boolean; summaryEntry?: BranchSummaryEntry }>;

  // Verbatim line compaction
  compact(options?: Partial<VerbatimCompactionParameters>): Promise<VerbatimCompactionResult>;
  abortCompaction(): void;

  // Abort current operation
  abort(): Promise<void>;

  // Cleanup
  dispose(): void;
}
```

`compact()` serializes older context to numbered lines, asks the session model for JSON deleted ranges, validates them, and mechanically reconstructs a durable verbatim transcript string. It appends a `compaction` entry with `details.strategy: "verbatim-lines"`; the recent tail remains ordinary messages. The model never authors replacement context text.

Session replacement APIs such as new-session, resume, fork, and import live on `AgentSessionRuntime`, not on `AgentSession`.

### createAgentSessionRuntime() and AgentSessionRuntime

Use the runtime API when you need to replace the active session and rebuild cwd-bound runtime state.
This is the same layer used by the built-in interactive, print, and RPC modes.

`createAgentSessionRuntime()` takes a runtime factory plus the initial cwd/session target. The factory closes over process-global fixed inputs, recreates cwd-bound services for the effective cwd, resolves session options against those services, and returns a full runtime result.

```typescript
import {
  type CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory,
  createAgentSessionFromServices,
  createAgentSessionRuntime,
  createAgentSessionServices,
  getAgentDir,
  SessionManager,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

const createRuntime: CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory = async ({ cwd, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent }) => {
  const services = await createAgentSessionServices({ cwd });
  return {
    ...(await createAgentSessionFromServices({
      services,
      sessionManager,
      sessionStartEvent,
    })),
    services,
    diagnostics: services.diagnostics,
  };
};

const runtime = await createAgentSessionRuntime(createRuntime, {
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agentDir: getAgentDir(),
  sessionManager: SessionManager.create(process.cwd()),
});
```

`AgentSessionRuntime` owns replacement of the active runtime across:

- `newSession()`
- `switchSession()`
- `fork()`
- clone flows via `fork(entryId, { position: "at" })`
- `importFromJsonl()`

Important behavior:

- `runtime.session` changes after those operations
- event subscriptions are attached to a specific `AgentSession`, so re-subscribe after replacement
- if you use extensions, call `runtime.session.bindExtensions(...)` again for the new session
- creation returns diagnostics on `runtime.diagnostics`
- if runtime creation or replacement fails, the method throws and the caller decides how to handle it

```typescript
let session = runtime.session;
let unsubscribe = session.subscribe(() => {});

await runtime.newSession();

unsubscribe();
session = runtime.session;
unsubscribe = session.subscribe(() => {});
```

### Prompting and Message Queueing

`PromptOptions` controls prompt expansion, queueing behavior while streaming, and prompt preflight notifications:

```typescript
interface PromptOptions {
  expandPromptTemplates?: boolean;
  images?: ImageContent[];
  streamingBehavior?: "steer" | "followUp";
  source?: InputSource;
  preflightResult?: (success: boolean) => void;
}
```

`preflightResult` is called once per `prompt()` invocation:

- `true` when the prompt was accepted, queued, or handled immediately
- `false` when prompt preflight rejected before acceptance

It fires before `prompt()` resolves. `prompt()` still resolves only after the full accepted run finishes, including retries. Failures after acceptance are reported through the normal event and message stream, not through `preflightResult(false)`.

The `prompt()` method handles prompt templates, extension commands, and message sending:

```typescript
// Basic prompt (when not streaming)
await session.prompt("What files are here?");

// With images
await session.prompt("What's in this image?", {
  images: [{ type: "image", source: { type: "base64", mediaType: "image/png", data: "..." } }]
});

// During streaming: must specify how to queue the message
await session.prompt("Stop and do this instead", { streamingBehavior: "steer" });
await session.prompt("After you're done, also check X", { streamingBehavior: "followUp" });
```

**Behavior:**
- **Extension commands** (e.g., `/mycommand`): Execute immediately, even during streaming. They manage their own LLM interaction via `pi.sendMessage()`.
- **File-based prompt templates** (from `.md` files): Expanded to their content before sending or queueing.
- **During streaming without `streamingBehavior`**: Throws an error. Use `steer()` or `followUp()` directly, or specify the option.
- **`preflightResult(true)`**: Means the prompt was accepted, queued, or handled immediately.
- **`preflightResult(false)`**: Means preflight rejected before acceptance.

For explicit queueing during streaming:

```typescript
// Queue a steering message for delivery after the current assistant turn finishes its tool calls
await session.steer("New instruction");

// Wait for agent to finish (delivered only when agent stops)
await session.followUp("After you're done, also do this");
```

Both `steer()` and `followUp()` expand file-based prompt templates but error on extension commands (extension commands cannot be queued).

`pauseQueuedMessages()` is a synchronous admission gate. It moves existing raw steering/follow-up entries into a hold before an abort boundary and keeps later context-bearing arrivals—including trigger-turn custom messages, batches, interrupts, `sendUserMessage()`, and ordinary `prompt()` calls—queued without starting a provider turn. Content blocks, optional data, duplicate identities, raw text, message types, and the existing order within each queue kind are retained. Non-trigger custom messages remain history-only and do not invent a turn.

`resumeQueuedMessages()` releases that hold exactly once but does **not** itself start or continue a model turn. Its promise resolves to `true` only when raw held steering/follow-up work was released, and to `false` when no held raw work existed. The caller must use its existing explicit resume action (for example, the interactive chat submission or workflow resume boundary) to drive execution. `clearQueue()` clears the paused flag when it explicitly removes the final unowned held item; if a protected or interrupt-owned item remains, the gate stays paused.

### Agent and AgentState

The `Agent` class (from `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`) handles the core LLM interaction. Access it via `session.agent`.

```typescript
// Access current state
const state = session.agent.state;

// state.messages: AgentMessage[] - conversation history
// state.model: Model - current model
// state.thinkingLevel: ThinkingLevel - current thinking level
// state.systemPrompt: string - system prompt
// state.tools: AgentTool[] - available tools
// state.streamingMessage?: AgentMessage - current partial assistant message
// state.errorMessage?: string - latest assistant error

// Replace messages (useful for branching or restoration)
session.agent.state.messages = messages; // copies the top-level array

// Replace tools
session.agent.state.tools = tools; // copies the top-level array

// Wait for agent to finish processing
await session.agent.waitForIdle();
```

### Events

Subscribe to events to receive streaming output and lifecycle notifications.

```typescript
session.subscribe((event) => {
  switch (event.type) {
    // Streaming text from assistant
    case "message_update":
      if (event.assistantMessageEvent.type === "text_delta") {
        process.stdout.write(event.assistantMessageEvent.delta);
      }
      if (event.assistantMessageEvent.type === "thinking_delta") {
        // Thinking output (if thinking enabled)
      }
      break;
    
    // Tool execution
    case "tool_execution_start":
      console.log(`Tool: ${event.toolName}`);
      break;
    case "tool_execution_update":
      // Streaming tool output
      break;
    case "tool_execution_end":
      console.log(`Result: ${event.isError ? "error" : "success"}`);
      break;
    
    // Message lifecycle
    case "message_start":
      // New message starting
      break;
    case "message_end":
      // Message complete
      break;
    
    // Agent lifecycle
    case "agent_start":
      // Agent started processing prompt
      break;
    case "agent_end":
      // Agent finished (event.messages contains new messages)
      break;
    
    // Turn lifecycle (one LLM response + tool calls)
    case "turn_start":
      break;
    case "turn_end":
      // event.message: assistant response
      // event.toolResults: tool results from this turn
      break;
    
    // Session events (queue, compaction, retry)
    case "queue_update":
      console.log(event.steering, event.followUp);
      break;
    case "compaction_start":
    case "compaction_end":
    case "auto_retry_start":
    case "auto_retry_end":
    case "summarization_retry_scheduled":
    case "summarization_retry_attempt_start":
    case "summarization_retry_finished":
      break;
  }
});
```

A subscriber that rebuilds the assistant message from these deltas must
accumulate them into its own message object. `message_start` reports the
message the model is about to stream, but an in-process subscriber receives the
provider's live partial rather than a snapshot of it, and the provider keeps
appending to that same object as the stream runs. Appending a delta to it adds
text the provider already added. A subscriber that attaches part-way through a
turn missed the deltas that came before it and can seed itself from
`session.agent.state.streamingMessage`, which holds the message currently being
streamed, if any.

## Options Reference

### Directories

```typescript
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  // Working directory for DefaultResourceLoader discovery
  cwd: process.cwd(), // default
  
  // Global config directory
  agentDir: "~/.atomic/agent", // default (expands ~)
});
```

Atomic reads primary `.atomic` locations first and legacy `.pi` locations for compatibility when multiple config directories are supported. Passing an explicit `agentDir` makes that directory the user override.

`cwd` is used by `DefaultResourceLoader` for:
- Project extensions (`.atomic/extensions/`, then legacy `.pi/extensions/`)
- Project skills:
  - `.atomic/skills/`, then legacy `.pi/skills/`
  - `.agents/skills/` in `cwd` and ancestor directories (up to git repo root, or filesystem root when not in a repo)
- Project prompts (`.atomic/prompts/`, then legacy `.pi/prompts/`)
- Context files (`AGENTS.override.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` walking up from cwd)
- Session directory naming

`agentDir` is used by `DefaultResourceLoader` for:
- Global extensions (`extensions/`)
- Global skills:
  - `skills/` under `agentDir` (for example `~/.atomic/agent/skills/`; legacy `~/.pi/agent/skills/` is also considered by default)
  - `~/.agents/skills/`
- Global prompts (`prompts/`)
- Global context files (`AGENTS.override.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` under `agentDir`)
- Settings (`settings.json`)
- Custom models (`models.json`)
- Credentials (`auth.json`)
- Sessions (`sessions/`)

When you pass a custom `ResourceLoader`, `cwd` and `agentDir` no longer control resource discovery. They still influence session naming and tool path resolution.

### Model

```typescript
import { getModel } from "@bastani/pi-ai/compat";
import { ModelRuntime } from "@bastani/atomic";

const modelRuntime = await ModelRuntime.create();

// Find specific built-in model (doesn't check if credentials exist)
const opus = getModel("anthropic", "claude-opus-4-5");
if (!opus) throw new Error("Model not found");

// Find any model by provider/id, including custom models from models.json
const customModel = modelRuntime.getModel("my-provider", "my-model");

// Get only models whose providers have configured authentication
const available = await modelRuntime.getAvailable();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  model: opus,
  thinkingLevel: "medium", // off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max (when supported by the model)
  
  // Models for cycling (CTRL+P in interactive mode)
  scopedModels: [
    { model: opus, thinkingLevel: "high" },
    { model: haiku, thinkingLevel: "off" },
  ],
  
  modelRuntime,
});
```

`ModelRegistry` keeps synchronous reads for extension compatibility, while catalog refresh is asynchronous. Extensions should await `modelRegistry.refresh()` before synchronous `getAll()`, `find()`, or `getAvailable()` reads when a provider may update its catalog. New SDK integrations use `ModelRuntime`; `await modelRuntime.refresh()` reports `aborted` and per-provider `errors`, and failed providers retain their last-known models.

If no model is provided:
1. Tries to restore from session (if continuing)
2. Uses default from settings
3. Falls back to first available model

> See [examples/sdk/02-custom-model.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/02-custom-model.ts)

#### Model catalog persistence and refresh

`ModelRuntime.create()` restores cached catalogs from local persistence but does not contact
pi.dev unless you opt in. `allowModelNetwork` (default `false`) enables a create-time network
refresh, and `modelRefreshTimeoutMs` (default `15_000`) bounds how long that refresh may run
before it is aborted. Pass `refreshOnCreate: false` to skip the initial catalog and
availability refresh entirely; built-in models remain available.

```typescript
const refreshedRuntime = await ModelRuntime.create({
  allowModelNetwork: true,
  modelRefreshTimeoutMs: 15_000,
});
```

Remote catalogs are persisted locally so later runtimes can restore them without a network
request. The default file is `models-store.json` next to `models.json` — with the default
`modelsPath` that is `~/.atomic/agent/models-store.json`. Set `modelsStorePath` to choose
another location, or inject `modelsStore` to control persistence entirely; a runtime created
with `modelsPath: null` keeps its store in memory. Network refreshes are throttled to once
per provider every four hours unless forced. To force an immediate refresh, call
`await modelRuntime.refresh({ allowNetwork: true, force: true, signal })`. Setting
`ATOMIC_OFFLINE` (legacy alias `PI_OFFLINE`) disables model network access, and a
`refresh()` call that omits `allowNetwork` follows that same runtime network policy.

### API Keys and OAuth

`ModelRuntime` is the asynchronous SDK engine for provider composition, credentials, model catalogs, and requests. `ModelRegistry` remains a thin compatibility facade for extensions; `await modelRegistry.complete(model, context, options)` routes a request through its runtime with the resolved provider and auth. New SDK integrations should pass `modelRuntime` to `createAgentSession` and use `modelRuntime.complete()` directly when they issue standalone requests.

Credential resolution combines runtime API-key overrides, stored `auth.json` credentials, environment variables, and the active `models.json` provider configuration. OAuth acquisition is provider-owned and runs through `ModelRuntime.login()`.

```typescript
import { AuthStorage, ModelRuntime } from "@bastani/atomic";

const authStorage = AuthStorage.create();
const modelRuntime = await ModelRuntime.create({ credentials: authStorage });

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  modelRuntime,
});

// Runtime API key override (not persisted to disk). Setting the key updates
// auth state; refresh the provider explicitly when its catalog must be current.
const providerId = "anthropic";
const authController = new AbortController();
await modelRuntime.setRuntimeApiKey(providerId, "sk-my-temp-key", { signal: authController.signal });
await modelRuntime.refresh({ providers: [providerId], signal: authController.signal });

// Custom credential and model configuration locations
const customRuntime = await ModelRuntime.create({
  authPath: "/my/app/auth.json",
  modelsPath: "/my/app/models.json",
});

const customSession = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  modelRuntime: customRuntime,
});

// Disable models.json while retaining built-in providers
const builtinsOnly = await ModelRuntime.create({ modelsPath: null });
```

> See the complete [`ModelRuntime` credential and model configuration example](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/09-api-keys-and-oauth.ts).

### System Prompt

Use a `ResourceLoader` to override the system prompt:

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, DefaultResourceLoader } from "@bastani/atomic";

const loader = new DefaultResourceLoader({
  systemPromptOverride: () => "You are a helpful assistant.",
});
await loader.reload();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({ resourceLoader: loader });
```

> See [examples/sdk/03-custom-prompt.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/03-custom-prompt.ts)

### Tools

Specify which tools to expose by name:

- Built-in tool names enabled by default: `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `find`, `search`, `ask_user_question`, `todo`
- `find` discovers filesystem paths by glob; `search` searches file contents with regex patterns across files, directories, globs, and internal URLs.
- `tools` is an allowlist: when provided, only the listed built-in, extension, and custom tool names are exposed, plus mandatory ordinary `intercom`.
- `excludedTools` is a blocklist: matching built-in, extension, and custom tool names are omitted from the final registry and active tool set, except mandatory ordinary `intercom`. If both are provided, `tools` is applied first and `excludedTools` subtracts from it.
- `noTools: "all"` disables every tool except mandatory ordinary `intercom`
- `noTools: "builtin"` disables default built-ins while keeping extension and custom tools enabled, except names listed in `excludedTools`

```typescript
import { createAgentSession } from "@bastani/atomic";

// Read-only mode. `tools` selects optional tools; ordinary Intercom remains active.
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  tools: ["read", "search", "find", "ls"],
});

// Pick specific optional tools. Ordinary Intercom remains active even when omitted.
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  tools: ["read", "bash", "search"],
});

// Keep defaults but remove HITL prompts
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  excludedTools: ["ask_user_question"],
});

// Allowlist first, then subtract exclusions
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  tools: ["read", "bash", "ask_user_question"],
  excludedTools: ["ask_user_question"], // optional tools: read, bash; ordinary Intercom remains active
});
```

#### Bash tool behavior

Atomic's built-in `bash` tool matches upstream pi: when `bash` is enabled, commands execute through the configured shell with the Atomic process permissions. Use `tools`, `excludedTools`, or `noTools` to decide whether a session exposes the `bash` tool at all. Atomic no longer provides a command-level allow/deny option for `bash`; use an operating-system/container sandbox or a custom tool/extension when you need command allowlisting or stronger isolation.


#### PowerShell tool behavior

`createPowerShellTool()` and `createPowerShellToolDefinition()` provide the same tool used by interactive sessions. When their default local operations execute on native Windows, they prefer `pwsh.exe`, fall back to `powershell.exe`, and throw a clear error when neither executable is available. `createLocalPowerShellOperations()` and `getPowerShellConfig()` are also exported for custom integrations. The PowerShell factories expose the current `ATOMIC_*` and legacy `PI_*` session snapshot by default; set `exposeSessionEnvironment: false` to opt out.

```typescript
import { createPowerShellTool } from "@bastani/atomic";

const powershell = createPowerShellTool("C:\\path\\to\\project");
```

#### Tools with Custom cwd

When you pass a custom `cwd`, `createAgentSession()` builds selected built-in tools for that cwd.

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, SessionManager } from "@bastani/atomic";

const cwd = "/path/to/project";

// Use default tools for custom cwd
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  cwd,
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(cwd),
});

// Or pick specific tools for custom cwd
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  cwd,
  tools: ["read", "bash", "search"],
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(cwd),
});
```

> See [examples/sdk/05-tools.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/05-tools.ts)

### Custom Tools

```typescript
import { Type } from "typebox";
import { createAgentSession, defineTool } from "@bastani/atomic";

// Inline custom tool
const myTool = defineTool({
  name: "my_tool",
  label: "My Tool",
  description: "Does something useful",
  parameters: Type.Object({
    input: Type.String({ description: "Input value" }),
  }),
  execute: async (_toolCallId, params) => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: `Result: ${params.input}` }],
    details: {},
  }),
});

// Pass custom tools directly
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  customTools: [myTool],
});
```

Use `defineTool()` for standalone definitions and arrays like `customTools: [myTool]`. Inline `pi.registerTool({ ... })` already infers parameter types correctly.

Custom tools passed via `customTools` are combined with extension-registered tools. Extensions loaded by the ResourceLoader can also register tools via `pi.registerTool()`.

If you pass `tools`, include each custom or extension tool name you want enabled, for example `tools: ["read", "bash", "my_tool"]`. Use `excludedTools` to remove a custom or extension tool by name from the final exposed set.

`ToolDefinition.constrainedSampling` is part of the public SDK and survives `defineTool()`, `customTools`, tool wrappers, session/staged inspection, and isolated execution. Use `{ type: "json_schema", strict: "prefer" | "require" }`, `{ type: "grammar", variants: { openai_lark?: string, openai_regex?: string } }`, or `false`. `prefer` can fall back; `require` fails when the active model cannot enforce strict JSON Schema. Grammar constraints require one required string parameter and capable model metadata. Public inspection preserves optional-property identity exactly: an omitted key stays absent, an explicitly present `undefined` stays present, and `false` or a config object remains unchanged. The exported `ConstrainedSamplingConfig` type and [extension reference](/extensions#constrained-sampling) define the exact shape. Typed RPC clients receive the four model capability flags through optional `ModelInfo.compat`; see [RPC](/rpc#get_available_models).

Factory-created `createBashTool()` instances receive the same execution-time `ATOMIC_SESSION_*`/`PI_SESSION_*` model and session snapshot as the built-in bash tool. Set `exposeSessionEnvironment: false` only when the subprocess must not receive it. `MessageRenderOptions.outputPad` is likewise passed to normal and isolated custom message renderers.

#### Structured output final results

`structured_output` is not registered in normal agent sessions by default. Add it only when a caller needs a machine-readable final-answer contract by registering the exported factory as a custom tool:

```typescript
import { Type, type Static } from "typebox";
import {
  createAgentSession,
  createStructuredOutputTool,
  type StructuredOutputCapture,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

const DecisionSchema = Type.Object({
  approved: Type.Boolean(),
  findings: Type.Array(Type.String()),
}, { additionalProperties: false });

type Decision = Static<typeof DecisionSchema>;
const capture: StructuredOutputCapture<Decision> = {
  called: false,
  value: undefined,
};

const structuredOutput = createStructuredOutputTool({
  schema: DecisionSchema,
  capture,
});

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  customTools: [structuredOutput],
});
```

The tool parameters are exactly the supplied schema: with `DecisionSchema`, the model calls `structured_output({ approved, findings })`. Array and primitive schemas are also accepted by the factory when the target provider/tool runtime supports them; the captured value is whatever JSON value matches the schema. A successful call stores the params in `capture.value`, returns them as pretty-printed JSON tool-result text for text print mode, keeps the flat value in tool `details`, writes the same JSON to the configured `output.outputPath` when an `output` file sink is configured, and sets `terminate: true` so there is no extra follow-up assistant turn. Atomic relies on the tool schema instead of extra structured-output parsing or sidecar validation. Structured-output tool definitions opt out of oversized-result persistence.

Custom tool names are supported, and the prompt metadata follows the configured name. If you use a custom name such as `final_decision`, include that name in any explicit `tools` allowlist. If the standard `structured_output` name is required, register the factory with its default name:

```typescript
const finalDecision = createStructuredOutputTool({
  name: "final_decision",
  schema: DecisionSchema,
  capture,
});
// The model is prompted to call final_decision exactly once, not structured_output.

await createAgentSession({
  customTools: [finalDecision],
  tools: ["final_decision"], // only this tool is enabled
});

await createAgentSession({
  customTools: [createStructuredOutputTool({ schema: DecisionSchema, capture })],
  // Registers the standard structured_output tool for this session only.
});
```

> See [examples/sdk/05-tools.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/05-tools.ts)

### Extensions

Extensions are loaded by the `ResourceLoader`. `DefaultResourceLoader` discovers extensions from `~/.atomic/agent/extensions/` and `.atomic/extensions/` first, then legacy `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` and `.pi/extensions/`, plus settings.json extension sources.

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, DefaultResourceLoader } from "@bastani/atomic";

const loader = new DefaultResourceLoader({
  additionalExtensionPaths: ["/path/to/my-extension.ts"],
  extensionFactories: [
    (pi) => {
      pi.on("agent_start", () => {
        console.log("[Inline Extension] Agent starting");
      });
    },
  ],
});
await loader.reload();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({ resourceLoader: loader });
```

`createAgentSession()` preserves resources from a supplied loader but restores Atomic's mandatory bundled Intercom extension after loader overrides, deferred reloads, and same-name extension or `customTools` collisions. The supplied loader still controls every optional extension.

Strict reloads (`failOnExtensionErrors: true`) require the loader's transactional `prepareReload()` support so a failed candidate cannot mutate live state before validation. `DefaultResourceLoader` provides that support. Custom loaders without it remain compatible with ordinary reloads, but strict reload fails before calling their mutating `reload()` method.

Extensions can register tools, subscribe to events, add commands, and more. See [Extensions](/extensions) for the full API.

**Event Bus:** Extensions can communicate via `pi.events`. Pass a shared `eventBus` to `DefaultResourceLoader` if you need to emit or listen from outside:

```typescript
import { createEventBus, DefaultResourceLoader } from "@bastani/atomic";

const eventBus = createEventBus();
const loader = new DefaultResourceLoader({
  eventBus,
});
await loader.reload();

eventBus.on("my-extension:status", (data) => console.log(data));
```

> See [examples/sdk/06-extensions.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/06-extensions.ts) and [Extensions](/extensions)

### Skills

```typescript
import {
  createAgentSession,
  DefaultResourceLoader,
  type Skill,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

const customSkill: Skill = {
  name: "my-skill",
  description: "Custom instructions",
  filePath: "/path/to/SKILL.md",
  baseDir: "/path/to",
  source: "custom",
};

const loader = new DefaultResourceLoader({
  skillsOverride: (current) => ({
    skills: [...current.skills, customSkill],
    diagnostics: current.diagnostics,
  }),
});
await loader.reload();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({ resourceLoader: loader });
```

> See [examples/sdk/04-skills.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/04-skills.ts)

### Context Files

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, DefaultResourceLoader } from "@bastani/atomic";

const loader = new DefaultResourceLoader({
  agentsFilesOverride: (current) => ({
    agentsFiles: [
      ...current.agentsFiles,
      { path: "/virtual/AGENTS.md", content: "# Guidelines\n\n- Be concise" },
    ],
  }),
});
await loader.reload();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({ resourceLoader: loader });
```

> See [examples/sdk/07-context-files.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/07-context-files.ts)

### Slash Commands

```typescript
import {
  createAgentSession,
  DefaultResourceLoader,
  type PromptTemplate,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

const customCommand: PromptTemplate = {
  name: "deploy",
  description: "Deploy the application",
  source: "(custom)",
  content: "# Deploy\n\n1. Build\n2. Test\n3. Deploy",
};

const loader = new DefaultResourceLoader({
  promptsOverride: (current) => ({
    prompts: [...current.prompts, customCommand],
    diagnostics: current.diagnostics,
  }),
});
await loader.reload();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({ resourceLoader: loader });
```

> See [examples/sdk/08-prompt-templates.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/08-prompt-templates.ts)

### Session Management

Sessions use a tree structure with `id`/`parentId` linking, enabling in-place branching.

```typescript
import {
  type CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory,
  createAgentSession,
  createAgentSessionFromServices,
  createAgentSessionRuntime,
  createAgentSessionServices,
  getAgentDir,
  SessionManager,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

// In-memory (no persistence)
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
});

// New persistent session
const { session: persisted } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.create(process.cwd()),
});

// Continue most recent
const { session: continued, modelFallbackMessage } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.continueRecent(process.cwd()),
});
if (modelFallbackMessage) {
  console.log("Note:", modelFallbackMessage);
}

// Open specific file
const { session: opened } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.open("/path/to/session.jsonl"),
});

// List sessions
const currentProjectSessions = await SessionManager.list(process.cwd());
const allSessions = await SessionManager.listAll(process.cwd());

// Session replacement API for /new, /resume, /fork, /clone, and import flows.
const createRuntime: CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory = async ({ cwd, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent }) => {
  const services = await createAgentSessionServices({ cwd });
  return {
    ...(await createAgentSessionFromServices({
      services,
      sessionManager,
      sessionStartEvent,
    })),
    services,
    diagnostics: services.diagnostics,
  };
};

const runtime = await createAgentSessionRuntime(createRuntime, {
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agentDir: getAgentDir(),
  sessionManager: SessionManager.create(process.cwd()),
});

// Replace the active session with a fresh one
await runtime.newSession();

// Replace the active session with another saved session
await runtime.switchSession("/path/to/session.jsonl");

// Replace the active session with a fork from a specific user entry
await runtime.fork("entry-id");

// Clone the active path through a specific entry
await runtime.fork("entry-id", { position: "at" });
```

**SessionManager tree API:**

```typescript
const sm = SessionManager.open("/path/to/session.jsonl");

// Session listing
const currentProjectSessions = await SessionManager.list(process.cwd());
const allSessions = await SessionManager.listAll(process.cwd());

// Tree traversal
const entries = sm.getEntries();        // All entries (excludes header)
const tree = sm.getTree();              // Full tree structure
const path = sm.getPath();              // Path from root to current leaf
const leaf = sm.getLeafEntry();         // Current leaf entry
const entry = sm.getEntry(id);          // Get entry by ID
const children = sm.getChildren(id);    // Direct children of entry

// Labels
const label = sm.getLabel(id);          // Get label for entry
sm.appendLabelChange(id, "checkpoint"); // Set label

// Branching
sm.branch(entryId);                     // Move leaf to earlier entry
sm.branchWithSummary(id, "Summary...");  // Branch with context summary
sm.createBranchedSession(leafId);       // Extract path to new file
```

> See [examples/sdk/11-sessions.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/11-sessions.ts) and [Session Format](/session-format)

### Settings Management

```typescript
import { createAgentSession, SettingsManager, SessionManager } from "@bastani/atomic";

// Default: loads from files (global + project merged)
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  settingsManager: SettingsManager.create(),
});

// With overrides
const settingsManager = SettingsManager.create();
settingsManager.applyOverrides({
  compaction: { enabled: false },
  retry: { enabled: true, maxRetries: 5 },
});
const { session } = await createAgentSession({ settingsManager });

// In-memory (no file I/O, for testing)
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  settingsManager: SettingsManager.inMemory({ compaction: { enabled: false } }),
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
});

// Custom directories
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  settingsManager: SettingsManager.create("/custom/cwd", "/custom/agent"),
});
```

**Static factories:**
- `SettingsManager.create(cwd?, agentDir?)` - Load from files
- `SettingsManager.inMemory(settings?)` - No file I/O

**Project-specific settings:**

Settings load from Atomic-first locations and merge:
1. Global: `~/.atomic/agent/settings.json`, then legacy `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`
2. Project: `<cwd>/.atomic/settings.json`, then legacy `<cwd>/.pi/settings.json`

Project overrides global. Nested objects merge keys. Setters modify global settings by default.

**Persistence and error handling semantics:**

- Settings getters/setters are synchronous for in-memory state.
- Setters enqueue persistence writes asynchronously.
- Call `await settingsManager.flush()` when you need a durability boundary (for example, before process exit or before asserting file contents in tests).
- `SettingsManager` does not print settings I/O errors. Use `settingsManager.drainErrors()` and report them in your app layer.

> See [examples/sdk/10-settings.ts](https://github.com/bastani-inc/atomic/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/sdk/10-settings.ts)

## ResourceLoader

Use `DefaultResourceLoader` to discover extensions, skills, prompts, themes, and context files.

```typescript
import {
  DefaultResourceLoader,
  getAgentDir,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

const loader = new DefaultResourceLoader({
  cwd,
  agentDir: getAgentDir(),
});
await loader.reload();

const extensions = loader.getExtensions();
const skills = loader.getSkills();
const prompts = loader.getPrompts();
const themes = loader.getThemes();
const contextFiles = loader.getAgentsFiles().agentsFiles;
```

## Return Value

`createAgentSession()` returns:

```typescript
interface CreateAgentSessionResult {
  // The session
  session: AgentSession;
  
  // Extensions result (for runner setup)
  extensionsResult: LoadExtensionsResult;
  
  // Warning if session model couldn't be restored
  modelFallbackMessage?: string;
}

interface LoadExtensionsResult {
  extensions: Extension[];
  errors: Array<{ path: string; error: string }>;
  runtime: ExtensionRuntime;
}
```

## Complete Example

```typescript
import { getModel } from "@bastani/pi-ai/compat";
import { Type } from "typebox";
import {
  AuthStorage,
  createAgentSession,
  DefaultResourceLoader,
  defineTool,
  ModelRuntime,
  SessionManager,
  SettingsManager,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

// Create a runtime with custom credential storage and no models.json.
const authStorage = AuthStorage.create("/custom/agent/auth.json");
const modelRuntime = await ModelRuntime.create({ credentials: authStorage, modelsPath: null });

// Runtime API key override (not persisted). setRuntimeApiKey updates auth state;
// the scoped refresh updates that provider's catalog.
if (process.env.MY_KEY) {
  const providerId = "anthropic";
  const authController = new AbortController();
  await modelRuntime.setRuntimeApiKey(providerId, process.env.MY_KEY, { signal: authController.signal });
  await modelRuntime.refresh({ providers: [providerId], signal: authController.signal });
}

// Inline tool
const statusTool = defineTool({
  name: "status",
  label: "Status",
  description: "Get system status",
  parameters: Type.Object({}),
  execute: async () => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: `Uptime: ${process.uptime()}s` }],
    details: {},
  }),
});

const model = getModel("anthropic", "claude-opus-4-5");
if (!model) throw new Error("Model not found");

// In-memory settings with overrides
const settingsManager = SettingsManager.inMemory({
  compaction: { enabled: false },
  retry: { enabled: true, maxRetries: 2 },
});

const loader = new DefaultResourceLoader({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agentDir: "/custom/agent",
  settingsManager,
  systemPromptOverride: () => "You are a minimal assistant. Be concise.",
});
await loader.reload();

const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agentDir: "/custom/agent",

  model,
  thinkingLevel: "off",
  modelRuntime,

  tools: ["read", "bash", "status"],
  customTools: [statusTool],
  resourceLoader: loader,

  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  settingsManager,
});

session.subscribe((event) => {
  if (event.type === "message_update" && event.assistantMessageEvent.type === "text_delta") {
    process.stdout.write(event.assistantMessageEvent.delta);
  }
});

await session.prompt("Get status and list files.");
```

## Run Modes

The SDK exports run mode utilities for building custom interfaces on top of `createAgentSession()`:

### InteractiveMode

Full TUI interactive mode with editor, chat history, and all built-in commands:

```typescript
import {
  type CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory,
  createAgentSessionFromServices,
  createAgentSessionRuntime,
  createAgentSessionServices,
  getAgentDir,
  InteractiveMode,
  SessionManager,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

const createRuntime: CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory = async ({ cwd, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent }) => {
  const services = await createAgentSessionServices({ cwd });
  return {
    ...(await createAgentSessionFromServices({ services, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent })),
    services,
    diagnostics: services.diagnostics,
  };
};
const runtime = await createAgentSessionRuntime(createRuntime, {
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agentDir: getAgentDir(),
  sessionManager: SessionManager.create(process.cwd()),
});

const mode = new InteractiveMode(runtime, {
  migratedProviders: [],
  modelFallbackMessage: undefined,
  initialMessage: "Hello",
  initialImages: [],
  initialMessages: [],
});

await mode.run();
```

### runPrintMode

Single-shot mode: send prompts, output result, exit:

```typescript
import {
  type CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory,
  createAgentSessionFromServices,
  createAgentSessionRuntime,
  createAgentSessionServices,
  getAgentDir,
  runPrintMode,
  SessionManager,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

const createRuntime: CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory = async ({ cwd, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent }) => {
  const services = await createAgentSessionServices({ cwd });
  return {
    ...(await createAgentSessionFromServices({ services, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent })),
    services,
    diagnostics: services.diagnostics,
  };
};
const runtime = await createAgentSessionRuntime(createRuntime, {
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agentDir: getAgentDir(),
  sessionManager: SessionManager.create(process.cwd()),
});

await runPrintMode(runtime, {
  mode: "text",
  initialMessage: "Hello",
  initialImages: [],
  messages: ["Follow up"],
});
```

### runRpcMode

JSON-RPC mode for subprocess integration:

```typescript
import {
  type CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory,
  createAgentSessionFromServices,
  createAgentSessionRuntime,
  createAgentSessionServices,
  getAgentDir,
  runRpcMode,
  SessionManager,
} from "@bastani/atomic";

const createRuntime: CreateAgentSessionRuntimeFactory = async ({ cwd, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent }) => {
  const services = await createAgentSessionServices({ cwd });
  return {
    ...(await createAgentSessionFromServices({ services, sessionManager, sessionStartEvent })),
    services,
    diagnostics: services.diagnostics,
  };
};
const runtime = await createAgentSessionRuntime(createRuntime, {
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agentDir: getAgentDir(),
  sessionManager: SessionManager.create(process.cwd()),
});

await runRpcMode(runtime);
```

See [RPC documentation](/rpc) for the JSON protocol.

## RPC Mode Alternative

For subprocess-based integration without building with the SDK, use the CLI directly:

```bash
atomic --mode rpc --no-session
```

See [RPC documentation](/rpc) for the JSON protocol.

The SDK is preferred when:
- You want type safety
- You're in the same Node.js process
- You need direct access to agent state
- You want to customize tools/extensions programmatically

RPC mode is preferred when:
- You're integrating from another language
- You want process isolation
- You're building a language-agnostic client
