# Atomic Packages

Atomic packages bundle extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes, and workflow definitions so you can share them through npm or git. Declare resources in `package.json` under the `atomic` key, or use conventional directories.

## Where to go next

Atomic packages bundle and distribute extensions, skills, prompts, themes, and workflows. Read this page to install and manage them, then continue:

- [Creating packages](/packages/authoring) — create a package, lay out its structure, and declare dependencies.
- [Package reference](/packages/reference) — filtering, scope, and deduplication contracts.

## Install and Manage

> **Security:** Atomic packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
atomic install npm:@foo/bar@1.0.0
atomic install git:github.com/user/repo@v1
atomic install https://github.com/user/repo  # raw URLs work too
atomic install /absolute/path/to/package
atomic install ./relative/path/to/package

atomic remove npm:@foo/bar
atomic list                     # show installed packages from settings
atomic update                   # update Atomic only
atomic update --all             # update Atomic, update packages, and reconcile pinned git refs
atomic update --extensions      # update packages and reconcile pinned git refs only
atomic update --models          # force-refresh authenticated provider model catalogs
atomic update --self            # update Atomic only
atomic update --self --force    # reinstall Atomic even if current
atomic update npm:@foo/bar      # update one package
atomic update --extension npm:@foo/bar
```

These commands manage Atomic packages and `atomic update` can update the Atomic CLI installation. To uninstall Atomic itself, see [Quickstart](/getting-started/installation#uninstall).

Self-update resolves an exact advertised package/version target and installs that pinned spec, so the update cannot drift to a newer registry release during installation. Any release note supplied by the update service is shown before installation. Atomic only updates installations it can verify are writable and managed by the detected global package manager; otherwise it prints a manual command. On Windows, loaded native dependencies are temporarily quarantined during replacement and stale quarantine directories are cleaned on later update attempts.

By default, `install` and `remove` write to user settings (`~/.atomic/agent/settings.json`). Use `-l` to write to project settings (`.atomic/settings.json`; legacy `.pi/settings.json` is also read) instead. Project settings can be shared with your team, and Atomic installs any missing packages automatically on startup after the project is trusted.

To try a package without installing it, use `--extension` or `-e`. This installs to a temporary directory for the current run only:

```bash
atomic -e npm:@foo/bar
atomic -e git:github.com/user/repo
```

For local directories, `-e <dir>` also borrows project-local Atomic resources under `<dir>/.atomic`, legacy `<dir>/.pi`, and `<dir>/.agents/skills` when present. Because borrowed extensions and workflows can execute code, Atomic resolves trust for that extension source before loading those borrowed project-local resources.

Workflows discovered through `-e` keep that same trusted resource set when they create child stage sessions. Stage agents get fresh resource loaders seeded from the parent snapshot, so package tools/extensions, subagents and agent definitions, skills, prompt templates, themes, workflows, and trusted borrowed project-local resources remain available in workflow stages unless the stage supplies its own explicit `resourceLoader`.

## Package Sources

Atomic accepts three source types in settings and `atomic install`.

### npm

```
npm:@scope/pkg@1.2.3
npm:pkg
```

- Versioned specs are pinned and skipped by package updates (`atomic update --extensions`, `atomic update --all`).
- User installs use the configured npm-compatible package-manager command (npm by default) and resolve from the managed Atomic npm area.
- Project installs go under `.atomic/npm/` (legacy `.pi/npm/` remains a compatibility fallback).
- Set `npmCommand` in `settings.json` to pin npm package lookup and install operations to a specific wrapper command such as `mise` or `asdf`.

Example:

```json
{
  "npmCommand": ["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]
}
```

### git

```
git:github.com/user/repo@v1
git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1
https://github.com/user/repo@v1
ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1
```

- Without `git:` prefix, only protocol URLs are accepted (`https://`, `http://`, `ssh://`, `git://`).
- With `git:` prefix, shorthand formats are accepted, including `github.com/user/repo` and `git@github.com:user/repo`.
- HTTPS and SSH URLs are both supported.
- SSH URLs use your configured SSH keys automatically (respects `~/.ssh/config`).
- For non-interactive runs (for example CI), you can set `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` to disable credential prompts and set `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` (for example `ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5`) to fail fast.
- Refs are pinned tags or commits. `atomic update --extensions` and `atomic update --all` do not move them to newer refs, but they do reconcile an existing clone to the configured ref.
- Use `atomic install git:host/user/repo@new-ref` to update settings and move an existing package to a new pinned ref.
- Cloned to `~/.atomic/agent/git/<host>/<path>` (global) or `.atomic/git/<host>/<path>` (project; legacy `.pi/git/` remains a compatibility fallback).
- When reconciliation changes the checkout, Atomic resets and cleans the clone, then runs the configured npm-compatible install command if `package.json` exists.

**SSH examples:**
```bash
# git@host:path shorthand (requires git: prefix)
atomic install git:git@github.com:user/repo

# ssh:// protocol format
atomic install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo

# With version ref
atomic install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1.0.0
```

### Local Paths

```
/absolute/path/to/package
./relative/path/to/package
```

Local paths point to files or directories on disk and are added to settings without copying. Relative paths are resolved against the settings file they appear in. If the path is a file, it loads as a single extension. If it is a directory, Atomic loads resources using package rules. Temporary local directories supplied with `-e` may also expose `.atomic`/`.pi` project-local resources and `.agents/skills` after the extension source is trusted.

## Package Filtering

Moved to [Package reference](/packages/reference#package-filtering).

## Enable and Disable Resources

Use `atomic config` to enable or disable extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes. It starts in global settings (`~/.atomic/agent/settings.json`); press Tab to switch global/project scope. Use `atomic config -l` to start in project overrides (`.atomic/settings.json`) with inherited global resources dimmed. Workflow package filters can be configured with `workflows` patterns.

## Scope and Deduplication

Moved to [Package reference](/packages/reference#scope-and-deduplication).
