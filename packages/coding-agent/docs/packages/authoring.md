# Creating packages

## Creating an Atomic Package

Add an app manifest to `package.json` or use conventional directories. The manifest key is the configured app name (`atomic` here, from `atomicConfig.name`; legacy `piConfig.name` is also read). The legacy `pi` key remains supported as a backwards-compatible shim. Include the `atomic-package` keyword for discoverability.

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["atomic-package"],
  "atomic": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"],
    "workflows": ["./workflows"]
  }
}
```

Paths are relative to the package root. Arrays support glob patterns and `!exclusions`.

### Gallery Metadata

The package gallery currently recognizes legacy `pi-package` metadata, while new Atomic packages should also include `atomic-package`. Add `video` or `image` fields to show a preview:

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["atomic-package", "pi-package"],
  "atomic": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "video": "https://example.com/demo.mp4",
    "image": "https://example.com/screenshot.png"
  }
}
```

- **video**: MP4 only. On desktop, autoplays on hover. Clicking opens a fullscreen player.
- **image**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP. Displayed as a static preview.

If both are set, video takes precedence.

## Package Structure

### Convention Directories

If no app manifest (`atomic`, or legacy `pi`) is present, Atomic auto-discovers resources from these directories:

- `extensions/` loads `.ts` and `.js` files
- `skills/` recursively finds `SKILL.md` folders and loads top-level `.md` files as skills
- `prompts/` loads `.md` files
- `themes/` loads `.json` files
- `workflows/` loads workflow SDK files (`.ts`, `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`); `workflow/` is also accepted as a singular alias. Workflow files import `workflow` from `@bastani/atomic/workflows`, import `Type` from `typebox`, and export the definition returned by `workflow({ ... })`. TypeScript resolves the published `@bastani/atomic/workflows` specifier through the `@bastani/atomic` package. Atomic resolves that workflow specifier and the supported TypeBox root, `typebox/compile`, `typebox/value`, and legacy `@sinclair/typebox` aliases to in-memory host modules when it loads the workflow at runtime. See [Programmatic usage](/workflows/api-reference#programmatic-usage).

When a package manifest exists, declared resource arrays normally define what loads. Workflows are the exception: if `atomic.workflows` / legacy `pi.workflows` is omitted, Atomic still checks conventional `workflows/` and `workflow/` directories.

## Dependencies

Third-party runtime dependencies belong in `dependencies` in `package.json`. Dependencies that do not register extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes, or workflows also belong in `dependencies`. When Atomic installs a package from npm or git, it runs the configured npm-compatible install command, so those dependencies are installed automatically.

Atomic bundles core packages for extensions and skills. If you import any of these, list them in `peerDependencies` with a `"*"` range and do not bundle them: `@bastani/pi-ai`, `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, `@bastani/atomic`, `@earendil-works/pi-tui`, `typebox`.

Workflow packages import `workflow` from `@bastani/atomic/workflows`, import `Type` from `typebox`, and export definitions returned by `workflow({ ... })`. List `@bastani/atomic` and `typebox` in `peerDependencies` so package consumers receive the workflow SDK and schema library.

Package-authored workflows should follow the same [guiding principles](/workflows/authoring#guiding-principles) as project workflows.

Other Atomic packages must be bundled in your tarball. Add them to `dependencies` and `bundledDependencies`, then reference their resources through `node_modules/` paths. Atomic loads packages with separate module roots, so separate installs do not collide or share modules.

Example:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "shitty-extensions": "^1.0.1"
  },
  "bundledDependencies": ["shitty-extensions"],
  "atomic": {
    "extensions": ["extensions", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/extensions"],
    "skills": ["skills", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/skills"]
  }
}
```
