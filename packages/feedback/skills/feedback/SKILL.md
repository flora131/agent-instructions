description: Draft a privacy-scrubbed Atomic bug report or enhancement through the ordinary conversation.

# Conversational feedback

Classify the user's request as a bug or enhancement.

For an enhancement, collect a title, what they want to change, and why. If the kind or one required field is unresolved, ask exactly one concise ordinary-text question, then stop. Let the next normal user message answer it; do not capture input or open a special interface.

When an enhancement is complete, call `feedback_prepare_issue` for the draft and display that tool's exact prepared Markdown — repository, kind, title, body, and privacy summary — as ordinary assistant Markdown without rewriting it. End with a plain request for edits or approval.

For a bug, collect a title, what happened, and reproduction steps. Include expected behavior and the Atomic version when the user supplies them. If a required field is unresolved, ask exactly one concise ordinary-text question, then stop and wait for the next normal user message. Do not invent reproduction steps or a cause.

Then call `feedback_collect_diagnostics` with the user's report and `phase: "before"`. Discover the available debugger with `subagent({ action: "list" })`. Launch the existing `debugger` exactly once with `context: "fresh"` and `wait: { kind: "foreground" }`; omit `model` and do not use the parallel `tasks` form. Give it only the scrubbed bounded diagnostic result and ask it to investigate and report supported evidence and unknowns without implementing a fix. If the foreground observation yields, wait for that same run's terminal result before collecting the after snapshot; do not launch another debugger. Then call `feedback_collect_diagnostics` with `phase: "after"` and the returned `snapshotId` as `since`.

When a bug is complete, call `feedback_prepare_issue` with `kind: "bug"`, including active non-builtin extensions, the user's `atomic -ne` isolation result or exactly `Not tested without extensions`, supported evidence, unknowns, and debugger-created paths from `createdPaths` as paths only. Never include file contents or raw artifacts. Display the tool's exact prepared Markdown, including repository, kind, title, body, and privacy summary, as ordinary assistant Markdown without rewriting it. End with a plain request for edits or approval.

Treat `createdPaths` as newly observed paths, not proof of who created them. If `baselineUnavailable` is present or `worktree.available` is false, disclose that the worktree comparison is unavailable and leave created paths unknown. Do not infer a clean worktree from an empty path list or read file contents to fill the gap.

If `worktree.truncated` or `createdPathsTruncated` is true, state in the draft's `unknowns` that the corresponding path list is incomplete and only its first 100 paths are shown. Keep `debuggerPaths` limited to the returned paths; do not imply that the list describes the whole worktree or investigation footprint.

If `subagent` or `debugger` is unavailable, interrupted, fails, or is inconclusive, continue to an honest editable draft. For unavailable or failed investigation, say `Investigation unavailable`, record the failure as supported evidence, leave the cause in unknowns, and do not invent findings.

Never launch a debugger for an enhancement. After displaying the exact prepared draft, wait for ordinary user approval or requested edits. For every requested revision, call `feedback_prepare_issue` again and display its exact prepared Markdown before asking again. Only then call `feedback_submit_issue` exactly once with the same reviewed kind, title, and body. Relay refusals and failures as ordinary text, never retry without fresh approval, and never invent an issue URL.
